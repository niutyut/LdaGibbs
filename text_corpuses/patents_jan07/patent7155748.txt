title: Releasable toilet seat assembly

abstract: 
A mount assembly releasable mounts a toilet seat and cover to a toilet base. The assembly includes two fasteners permanently affixed to the toilet base engaged by deflectable arms of one or two base members of the mount assembly. The arms engage ring mounts disposed about the fasteners, flexing outward slightly during mounting and dismounting achieved by a simple horizontal sliding motion. When connected, hinged covers snap onto the pair of arms to cover the fasteners and prevent deflection of the arms and thus separation of the base member(s) from the fasteners.
