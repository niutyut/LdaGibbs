The filtering apparatus includes a casing, a toothed gate formed in a part of the casing, close to the water-receiving tank, and a filtering unit which filters water overflown from the water-receiving tank and passing through the gate, in multiple stages, and which causes the filtered drain water to flow into the water-pumping tank.
