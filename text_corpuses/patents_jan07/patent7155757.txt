abstract: 
Various embodiments of the invention relate to a seat mounted on wheels for rolling along wheel tracks of parallel longitudinal members of a frame having end members connecting the longitudinal members. The frame may be placed on an upper surface of a bath enclosure such as a bathtub or shower unit and turnbuckles in the longitudinal members may be used to friction fit the longitudinal members to vertical surfaces at the end of the bathtub or shower unit. Moreover, the seat may have a bottom portion hingedly attached to a seat back portion so that the seat can be stowed at one end of the bath enclosure by folding the bottom portion towards the back portion.
