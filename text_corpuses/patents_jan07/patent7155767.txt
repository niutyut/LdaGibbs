title: Scrub cleaning device, scrub cleaning method, and manufacturing method of information recording medium

abstract: 
There is disclosed a scrub cleaning device which can reduce cleaning time and which requires no large-scaled device for transferring a substrate to the next cleaning process. The scrub cleaning device comprises: a scrub pad  provided with two annular plate scrubbers ?, and wheels ? for supporting an inner peripheral surface A of the annular plate scrubber and a surface B opposite a scrub surface so that the scrub surfaces of the two annular plate scrubbers ? fit each other, and for rotating the scrubber around-the central shaft of the annular plate scrubber; and a guide member (not shown), disposed along the outer periphery of the scrub pad , for conveying the substrate in the rotation direction of the scrub pad , and the scrub cleaning of the substrate is performed when the substrate held between the two opposite scrubbers ? is conveyed in the rotation direction of the scrubbers ? by rotation of the scrub pad , and rotated by a friction force generated by abutment on the guide member.
