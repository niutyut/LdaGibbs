title: Electric-motored floor-surface polisher

abstract: 
An electric-motored floor-surface polisher includes a pair of pads juxtaposed in the front and rear or lateral direction of an apparatus frame, each pad being slidably supported to the apparatus frame. A drive pulley coupled to an output shaft of an electric motor to be rotated therewith. The polisher includes a pair of pad driving members, each pad driving member having an input pulley portion operably coupled with the drive pulley via a toothed belt and having also an output portion provided at a portion of the driving member offset from a rotational axis of the input pulley portion to be rotatable therewith and a pair of pad operating rods, one of the pair of pad operating rods having one end thereof pivotally coupled with the output portion of one of the pair of pad driving members and the other end thereof pivotally coupled with the one of the pair of pads and the other pad operating rod having one end thereof pivotally coupled with the output portion of the other pad driving member and the other end thereof pivotally coupled with the other pad. With this, the pair of pad operating rods slidably reciprocate the pair of pads along the juxtaposing direction thereof and in directions opposite to each other.
