title: Wire management grommet with non-captive closure member

abstract: 
This invention relates to a two-piece grommet adapted for holding a cable in an aperture, such as in a desk or work surface so as to absorb any strain imposed on the cable and to provide an attractive covering for the hole drilled to pass the cable. The grommet consists of two portions. The first portion comprises a cylindrical sleeve having a circular lip. The second portion comprises a cap having an extended flange and adapted to frictionally fit into the cylindrical sleeve and against the lip. The cap has an aperture cut into it through which the cable passes. A pivotal tab is connected under the cap to close the aperture when no cable passes therethrough.
