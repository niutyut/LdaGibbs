title: Multipurpose hinge apparatus having automatic return function

abstract: 
A multipurpose hinge apparatus having an automatic return function is provided in which the apparatus is installed between the door and a main body. The apparatus includes a driving mechanism for ascending and descending a piston rod according to opening and closing of the door which is installed in the upper portion of a cylindrical housing. A piston is connected with the piston rod, in which a one-direction check valve is installed in the piston. The piston partitions an upper chamber and a lower chamber and ascends and descends in association with the piston rod. A first oil path communicates with the upper and lower chambers via the lower portion of the piston rod in the central portion of the piston. A compression spring which makes the piston ascend is inserted into the lower chamber. Oil is filled in the chamber. Thus, the hinge apparatus is automatically returned to the initial position with return speed in multiple steps by controlling an amount of oil flowing from upper chamber to lower chamber in multiple steps when a door is closed.
