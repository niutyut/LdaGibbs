title: Connecting rod cap separator system

abstract: 
A connecting rod cap separator system comprising a housing having a pair generally side components each with an inside face and an outside faces adapted to fit inside the circular aperture of a connecting rod; a pair of support screws; an activation shaft with a threading and a crank lever; and a pair displacing wedges each having a pair of sloped faces and apertures extending there through. The apertures are adapted to receive the activation shaft such that when the activation shaft is rotated by the crank lever in one direction, threading of a displacing wedge draw the wedges closer together thereby displacing the side components of the housing outwardly to an expanded state, and when the activation shaft is rotated by the crank lever in the opposite direction, threading of a displacing wedge expands the wedges away from each other thereby contracting the side components of the housing inwardly to the contracted state.
