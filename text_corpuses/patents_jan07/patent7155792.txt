title: Hand ratchet quick release brake pad spreader tool

abstract: 
A hand ratchet quick release brake pad spreader tool that is a hand tool for spreading a disc brake pad connected to a piston in a caliper housing, thereby compressing the piston into the caliper housing. The hand tool consists of a shaft having a ram affixed onto a front end that slidably extends through a central aperture in a frame member and a central through bore in a backing plate that is mounted to a forward end of the frame member. A trigger handle is pivotally affixed to the frame member adjacent to a depending fixed handle on the frame member. A mechanism is for moving the shaft forwards when the trigger handle is squeezed towards the fixed handle by a hand of a person. A mechanism is for holding the shaft stationary thereby preventing the shaft from moving backwards when the trigger handle is released.
