title: Method for assembling a modular sports field

abstract: 
A modular synthetic grass playing surface system formed from a plurality of modular units. Each modular unit has a synthetic grass layer placed upon predetermined sized pallets having a pre-installed elastomeric layer. A layer of resilient particle infill is optionally introduced to the top surface of the modular unit. A corrugated plastic sleeve is optionally installed around each formed modular unit while the modular unit is stored and moved. A plurality of modular units are then installed onto a relatively flat surface to form the playing surface in a desired shape and size.
