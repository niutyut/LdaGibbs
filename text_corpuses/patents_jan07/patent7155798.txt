title: Method for the attachment of a functional element to a sheet metal part and also a component assembly

abstract: 
A method for the attachment of a functional element, for example in the form of an RSN or RND element of the company Profil Verbindungstechnik GmbH & Co. KG, is described in which the hole in the sheet metal part is so formed that the sheet metal part lies in one plane in the region confronting the end face of the riveting die button and at least substantially does not project beyond this plane. The hole in the sheet metal part has an inner diameter which is larger than the outer diameter of the rivet section of the element, ignoring any features present there providing security against rotation, by an amount which ensures that the marginal region of the hole is deformed by the action of the riveting die button out of the sheet metal plane and in the direction of the body section of the functional element before the marginal region of the hole enters into contact with the riveting section as a result of the formation of the rivet bead, so that neither a bending of the marginal region of the hole out of the sheet metal plane nor the formation of the rivet bead is prevented.
