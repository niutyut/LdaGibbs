title: Method of producing superconductors

abstract: 
Method of producing superconducting cables by using cold plastic deformation operations only including the step of obtaining a bar-like semi-finished product of prefixed dimension through the steps of: forming round-section, mono- or multifilament, superconducting copper bars of relatively long length; assembling the bars about a cylindrical copper core of substantially the same length, using assembly templates, the templates having through holes arranged in a circle to support the bars, and a central through seat for supporting the core; tying the bars onto an outer lateral surface of the core; sliding onto one end of the bar/core assembly a number of metal supporting rings, while sliding the templates off the opposite end thereof; sliding a copper tube onto the bar/core assembly while cutting the ties in axial sequence and sliding off the supporting rings; and subjecting the assembly to a number of drawing operations.
