title: Method of making thin film magnetic head

abstract: 
A thin-film magnetic head comprises at least one of a magnetoresistive device and an electromagnetic transducer, and a heater adapted to generate heat upon energization. A method of making this thin-film magnetic head comprises a heater forming step of forming the heater, and an annealing step of annealing the heater formed by the heater forming step.
