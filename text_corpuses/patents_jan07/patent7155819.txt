title: System for making a conductive circuit on a substantially non-conductive substrate

abstract: 
A method for forming a conductive circuit on a substantially non-conductive substrate includes indenting a major surface of a substrate with a plurality of features, plating the major surface and the indentations formed with a conductive layer, and removing a portion of the conductive layer leaving at least one of the plurality of the indentations filled with conductive material separated from at least one other of the plurality of the indentations filled with conductive material separated by non-conductive material. An electrical device formed includes a sheet of insulative material having grooves therein. The sheet of insulative material has a first planar surface, and a second planar surface. A conductive material is positioned within the grooves. The conductive material within the grooves forms electrical traces in the electrical device. The conductive material within the grooves fills the groove and includes a surface coplanar with at least one of the first planar surface or the second planar surface. Other electrical devises can be formed using multiple sheets formed with electrical traces.
