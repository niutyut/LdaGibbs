title: Laser alignment method and apparatus

abstract: 
Laser alignment methods and apparatus are disclosed whereby pipe and similar materials may be aligned. The methods and apparatus are adapted to be utilized on the end of pipe or other material and thereby using as a reference point that pipe or other material with the reference beam generated by the laser providing a center reference point from the pipe on which the laser is mounted. In a preferred embodiment, the laser apparatus mounting is threaded so as to be used in mating relationship with the ends of complementarily threaded pipes. A preferred embodiment has a mounting adaptor for the laser that either has tapered steps or is shaped like a tapered cone so that a single adaptor can be friction fitted into pipes of different diameters.
