title: Method and apparatus for using magnetic field

abstract: 
Provided a method and apparatus for using a magnetic field. The method includes: measuring and storing magnetic field data indicating magnitudes of a magnetic field in different directions at each time by rotating sensors over a space; and checking whether a disturbance of the magnetic field exists, using curve fitting parameters such as amplitude and offset of at least one of magnetic field trajectories formed by the stored magnetic field data.
