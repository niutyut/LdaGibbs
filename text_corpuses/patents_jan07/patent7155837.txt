title: Geomagnetic sensor for detecting dip angle and method thereof

abstract: 
A geomagnetic sensor includes a geomagnetic detection module configured to output an electrical signal having a magnitude corresponding to a magnetic field; a memory configured to store an azimuth measured in a horizontal plane; an accelerometer module configured to measure a tilt at present, and to compute a tilt angle therefrom; and a controller configured to calculate a dip angle by using the electrical signal outputted from the geomagnetic detection module, the tilt angle, and the horizontal azimuth. A method for detecting a dip angle by a geomagnetic sensor includes outputting an electrical signal having a magnitude corresponding to an external geomagnetic field; detecting an azimuth in a horizontal plane and storing the detected azimuth; measuring a tilt at present and computing a tilt angle thereof; and calculating a dip angle by using the electrical signal, the tilt angle, and the azimuth measured in the horizontal plane.
