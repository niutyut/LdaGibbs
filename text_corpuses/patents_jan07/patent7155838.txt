title: Apparatus for gauging a dimension of an object

abstract: 
An apparatus for gauging the dimension of an object. The apparatus has a wall with a generally flat front surface, facing a first direction, and a peripheral edge. Space graduations are provided on the wall relative to which a dimension of an object placed in front of the wall can be gauged. The surface on the wall reflects an image of an object located in front of the wall. At least one of i) a depiction of at least one of a) an animate object; b) an inanimate object; and c) a scene; ii) at least one word; iii) a design; and iv) a logo is provided on the wall and is viewable from in front of the wall in conjunction with the spaced graduations and a reflected image from the surface on the wall. The wall is formed so that the shape of at least a portion of the peripheral edge is at least nominally matched in shape to a shape of at least a portion of the at least one of i) a depiction of at least one of a) an animate object; b) an inanimate object; and c) a scene; ii) at least one word; iii) a design; and iv) and a logo.
