title: Device for mounting decorative and functional items

abstract: 
A device for easy positioning, leveling, marking and hanging of all types of pictures, sconces, decorative shelves, mirrors, and other devices to be mounted on a support surface. It has elongated vertical and horizontal support members attached together, each preferably with resilient legs. The vertical support has a handle at one end, a surface rest at its other end, and a rotatable sliding level. Sliding hook clips are positioned along the horizontal support, each having a front hook for holding an item to be hung while positioning and marking with an opposed marking implement take place. One or more hook clips can be used simultaneously. Flexing or compression of legs, soft pads, vertical support member, and/or horizontal support member reduces the wall stand-off distance of the device and causes the aligned marking implements to contact and mark the wall exactly where the held item should be permanently mounted.
