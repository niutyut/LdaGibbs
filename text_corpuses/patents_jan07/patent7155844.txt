title: Shock-absorbing shoe structure having adjustable elasticity

abstract: 
A shock-absorbing shoe structure having adjustable elasticity is disclosed. The shoe structure includes a buffering mechanism having a bottom holding plate, a buffering module, and a top holding plate. The buffering module includes a base seat, an elastic tube body, an end mount, a connection element, a pivotal seat, a rotating button, a securing screw rod, a top swinging arm, and a bottom-swinging arm. By rotating the rotating button, the elastic tube body is compressed and released via a connection element. Thus, the elasticity and the buffering effect of the shoe can be adjusted.
