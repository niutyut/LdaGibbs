title: Sliding door having lateral keeper

abstract: 
A top-supported sliding door system or a vertically sliding door system achieves an enhanced air seal with a lateral keeper mechanism on either or both of the trailing and leading edges. On an outward lateral edge of a door panel, a keeper projects inwardly toward the door frame to engage a door frame camming surface such as a pin. The bracket may advantageously disengage under a force indicative of impact in order to minimize damage resulting therefrom. Application of the lateral keeper mechanism may further be used on vertically sliding doors and on multi-panel horizontal sliding doors. In addition, a rail may extend from the angled pin to engage the keeper throughout the full travel of the door panel.
