title: Caulkless panelized wall system

abstract: 
Disclosed herein are caulkless panelized wall systems and methods for their construction, wherein the wall systems have elastomeric joints that are resistant to cracking. Building panels are fastened to a frame with the edges adjacent to each other. No caulk is applied to the seam between the building panels. A backing material is applied over the seam between the panels and the wall is then finished with an elastomeric finish.
