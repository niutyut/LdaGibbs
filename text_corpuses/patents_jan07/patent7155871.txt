title: Floor plank

abstract: 
The floor plank is a laminate of two layers of flexible plastic sheet material laminated together in offset relationship to define an offset marginal portion for each of the layers. Each of the offset marginal portions have oppositely facing adhesive coated surfaces. A foam layer and/or a fiberglass sheet can also be included in the laminate structure of the floor plank. The floor plank can conform to surface contours of a floor base. The bottom layer of the floor plank, whether it is plastic sheet or foam, is conformable to surface irregularities of the floor base. A one piece releasable packaging device covers the oppositely facing adhesive coated surfaces of the offset marginal portions.
