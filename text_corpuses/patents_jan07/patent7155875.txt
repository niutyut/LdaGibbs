title: Method of forming a perimeter weighted foundation for wind turbines and the like

abstract: 
A perimeter weighted foundation has a central pier pedestal and an enlarged base spaced outwardly and extending below the pedestal. The enlarged base includes an outer concentric perimeter wall section with a radially extending, disk-shaped spread section interconnecting the bottom of the pedestal section and the top of the perimeter wall section. The pedestal section includes vertically extending post-tensioning anchor bolts sleeved through substantially the entire height of the cylindrical pedestal in accordance with earlier U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,586,417 and 5,826,387 and the spread section includes two layers of similarly sleeved post-tensioning bolts which extend through the bottom of the pedestal section and into or through the top of the perimeter wall section, thus tying together the enlarged base to the pier pedestal. After the concrete is poured, hardened and cured, the vertical bolts of the pedestal section and the radially extending horizontal bolts in the spread section are post-tensioned to impart a heavy unit compressive loading on the concrete in the pier pedestal and enlarged base. After back filling soil onto the spread section and to the interior of the pedestal section, the foundation is able to withstand high upset forces imparted to the foundation by any large structure supported thereon.
