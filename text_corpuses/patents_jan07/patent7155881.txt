title: Method of securing valuables in a tote bag assembly

abstract: 
A valuable securing tote bag assembly and method includes a housing that has a bottom wall and a peripheral wall that is attached to and extends upwardly from the bottom wall. Each of the bottom and peripheral walls is flexible. The peripheral wall has an upper edge that forms a plurality of outer flaps. An inner flap is attached to an inner surface of the peripheral wall and divides the housing into an upper portion and a lower portion. A fastener is removably extendable through the outer flaps so that the outer flaps are secured together to define a closed position of the housing. The lower portion of the housing is filled with sand and valuables are positioned in the upper portion of the housing. The outer flaps are then secured together with the fastener.
