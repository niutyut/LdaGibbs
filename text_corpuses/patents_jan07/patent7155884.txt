title: Stretch wrap threading device

abstract: 
A stretching device for a stretch wrap machine includes a support structure and a film support for rotatably holding a roll of stretchable film. First and second rollers are rotatably mounted to the support structure. The stretching device includes a take-off device for supporting film as it is fed from the stretching device. A power drive assembly includes a motor, and the power drive assembly is configured to rotate the first and second rollers to stretch a film between the rollers. The stretching device further includes an elongated flexible member forming a loop and having a connector adapted for securing stretchable film. A guide assembly adjacent first ends of the first and second rollers movably supports the elongated flexible member to guide stretchable film through the stretching device. A disengagable drive is operably coupled to the elongated flexible member to provide powered movement of the elongated flexible member. The drive member is disengagable from the motor such that the first and second rollers can be rotated under power while the elongated flexible member is disengaged from the motor. The stretching device may be utilized with wrapping machines having a rotatable base or a turntable, or with wrapping machines of the type having an arm that rotates to wrap film about packages. The stretching device may include a tensioning device that tensions the chain.
