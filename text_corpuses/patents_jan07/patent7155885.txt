title: Small profile strapping tool

abstract: 
A small profile strapping tool includes a body defining a cylinder housing, a piston disposed within a cylinder in the cylinder housing, a pneumatic weld motor operably connected to the piston for actuation during a weld cycle, a pneumatic tensioning motor for actuation during a tensioning cycle, and a pneumatic module removably mounted to the cylinder housing. Within the module, a pilot valve controls a flow of gas into the module, a tensioning motor valve controls gas flow to the tensioning motor to draw tension in the strap, a weld cycle valve controls gas flow to the weld motor and piston, a timer and an accumulator are configured to isolate gas flow to the weld motor upon reaching a predetermined pressure in the accumulator following actuation, and a pneumatic signal circuit disposed between the cylinder and a bleed valve includes a signal valve that controls actuation of the bleed valve to route gas to the tension motor to maintain tension in the strap following the weld cycle.
