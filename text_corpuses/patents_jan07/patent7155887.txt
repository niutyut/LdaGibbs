title: Saddle cloths

abstract: 
A saddle cloth for equestrian use to be applied to a horse prior to application of the saddle has zones adapted to lie beneath the saddle panels at respective sides of the horse. Each zone includes within a pocket, a separate air bag at least in a forward and a rearward part of the zone such that each air bag serves to apply a relatively even pressure to the back of the horse. Each air bag is substantially flat and is filled within its interior with a resiliently compressible open cell foam and air sealed within the bag is substantially at atmospheric pressure.
