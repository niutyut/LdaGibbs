title: Material for gland packing and the gland packing

abstract: 
A gland packing including strip-like expanded graphite is disposed on one face of a sheet-like reinforcing member configured by a fibrous material to form a strip-like base member. The base member is stranded to be formed as a cord-like member. The outside of the cord-like member is covered by a portion of the strip-like expanded graphite, and the whole reinforcing member and the remaining portion of the strip-like expanded graphite are involved in the cord-like member. A large number of openings are formed in the reinforcing member. The strip-like expanded graphite faces the openings. The strip-like expanded graphite is engaged with the openings.
