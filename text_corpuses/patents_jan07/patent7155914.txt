title: Cooling structure for electronic equipment

abstract: 
A cooling structure for electronic equipment is designed for cooling a heat-generating body () disposed inside a case () by recovering heat generated by the heat-generating body () and dissipating the heat to the outside of the case (). The cooling structure includes a heat-receiving section () for recovering heat generated in the heat-generating body (), a thermally insulated space () provided with an air inflow orifice () and an air outflow orifice () and thermally insulated from the heat-generating body () and heat-receiving section () by a thermally insulating member (), a heat-dissipating section () provided inside the thermally insulated space (), a heat transfer member () for transferring the heat recovered in the heat-receiving section () to the heat-dissipating section (), and a fan () for generating forcibly an air flow in the thermally insulated space (). The heat generated by the heat-generating body () is transferred to the heat-dissipating section () via the heat-receiving section () and heat transfer member () and dissipated in a concentrated fashion by using the fan () inside the thermally insulated space ().
