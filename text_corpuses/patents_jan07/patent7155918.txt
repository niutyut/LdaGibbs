title: System for processing and transporting compressed natural gas

abstract: 
A system for processing and transporting compressed natural gas having a separator for separating the pressurized high-energy content gas into saturated gas and liquids; a decontamination unit for removing impurities from the saturated gas to create a decontaminated saturated gas; a dehydration unit for dehydrating the decontaminated saturated gas to remove water forming a dry pressurized gas; a chiller for cooling the dry pressurized gas cooled from ambient temperature to between ?80 Fahrenheit and ?120 Fahrenheit forming a two-phase gas; a floating vessel; at least one storage module located on the floating vessel that maintains a pressure ranging from 800 psi and 1200 psi; and wherein the floating vessel transports at least one storage module a distance ranging between 500 nautical miles and 2500 nautical miles and utilizes the vapor phase during transit to power the floating vessel.
