title: Refrigerant cycle with tandem compressors and multiple condensers

abstract: 
A tandem compressor system is utilized that receives refrigerant from a common suction manifold, and from a common evaporator. From the compressors, the refrigerant passes to a plurality of condensers, with each of the condensers being associated with a separate zone for heat rejection, preferably at different temperature levels. Each of the condensers is associated with at least one of the plurality of compressors. By utilizing the common evaporator, yet a plurality of condensers, the ability to independently control temperature and amount of heat rejection to a number of zones is achieved without the requirement of having a dedicated circuit with multiple additional components. Thus, the overall system cost and complexity can be greatly reduced. In embodiments, one or more of the plurality of compressors can be provided by a compressor bank, having its own plurality of compressors.
