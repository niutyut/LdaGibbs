title: Air conditioning system and air conditioning method

abstract: 
A driving method of an air conditioning system is disclosed. The air conditioning system includes a first cooling device combined with a heating function and having a compressor, an outdoor heat exchanger, an expansion device, a passage control device and an interior heat exchanger, a second cooling device provided at an outlet side of the blower and having a cooling pad containing moisture and ventilating, a tank storing refrigerant, a pump, a sprayer and a filter, a control unit electrically connecting to the first and second cooling devices and a humidity sensor and alternatively driving the first cooling device and the second cooling device according to humidity of outdoor air delivered from the humidity sensor during air conditioning mode. The driving method of the present invention includes steps of measuring humidity of outdoor air at the humidity sensor when the power of the air conditioning system is on; comparing humidity of outdoor air with predetermined humidity; driving a first cooling device circulating refrigerant by using a compressor for cooling the interior when humidity of outdoor air is higher than predetermined humidity, and driving a second cooling device sucking outdoor air with low relative humidity, increasing the relative humidity through humidifying and cooling process and providing the air into the interior for cooling the interior when humidity of outdoor air is lower than predetermined humidity.
