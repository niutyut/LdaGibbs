title: Portable air conditioner

abstract: 
An apparatus and method for cooling air that utilizes a removable reservoir that may be filled with a consumable beverage or other cooled liquid or solid material. The bottom of the reservoir is made of a thermally conductive material that is placed within an air duct within a base unit that has a battery powered fan capable of drawing in warm air from outside of the base unit and cooling it by passing it over the thermally conductive material in a turbulent fashion and expelling it back into the surrounding environment. An expandable hose may also be included to direct the airflow in a desired direction or location. The unit may also include an alternative path for airflow such that the airflow may be heated. The unit may also be secured to an open air vehicle such as a golf cart to provide cooled or heated air for golf course patrons. Another important feature of the air conditioner is to provide a means to prevent unauthorized access to the contents of the reservoir as to prevent contamination of its contents.
