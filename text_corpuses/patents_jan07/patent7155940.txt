title: Three-piece panty garment and methods of making

abstract: 
A three-piece panty garment can include three panels formed from halves of tubular blanks knit on a small-diameter circular knitting machine designed for making pantyhose. As a result, such a panty garment can comprise a girth that is substantially three times the diameter of a small-diameter circular knitting machine knitting cylinder. Such panty garments and methods of making such panty garments can provide larger size panty garments, for example, size 10, 12, and 14, made on a circular knitting machine designed for making pantyhose.
