title: Knitting machine having variable rate-changing mechanism

abstract: 
There are provided a stitch cam including a first cam in which a stitch size determining cam surface for a large-sized stitch and a receiving cam surface are formed in the same phase, and a second cam which has a common retracting cam surface and in which a receiving cam surface is formed in the same phase as a stitch size determining cam surface for the small-sized stitch, and drive mechanism for the first cam and the second cam, wherein the second cam is supported on the first cam in such a manner that when the first cam is shifted in the front-and-back direction by the drive mechanism of the first cam, the second cam is shifted together in the front-and-back direction and also shifted relative thereto in the front-and-back direction by the drive mechanism of the second cam so that the stitch size determining cam surface provided in the second cam can be displaced with respect to the stitch size determining cam surface provided in the first cam, whereby a small-sized stitch and a large-sized stitch are formed in the same course.
