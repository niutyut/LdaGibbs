title: Combination lock and padlock combination with mechanism for visually indicating key opening permission

abstract: 
A combination lock and padlock combination for visually indicating a key opening permission being allowed or not is disclosed. A wheel includes two opposite projections on one end surface, spaced protuberances on the other end surface, two opposite key opening marks provided on an outer surface, and an annular flange proximate the protuberances, the flange being partially exposed. In response to turning the wheel to conceal the marks, a co-owner is aware that a key opening mechanism is disabled. Also, forcedly inserting a key into the key opening mechanism for opening the combination will be futile since a downward movement path of a protrusion on a spring biased shuttle assembly is blocked by the lower projection even if an engagement member of the key opening mechanism is aligned with mated bottom legs of the shuttle assembly.
