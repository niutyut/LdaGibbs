title: Lock having a lockable handle shaft

abstract: 
A lock including a frame, a handle operated latch bolt, a handle shaft, a latch bolt actuating mechanism and a mechanism for locking the handle shaft. The latch bolt locking mechanism includes a locking lever which is fixed with respect to the handle shaft and arranged to cooperate with a stop element on the frame. The latch bolt locking mechanism further includes an electromagnet which moves the locking lever with respect to the handle shaft or the stop element with respect to the frame so that the locking lever can be unlocked and locked behind the stop element. The locking device, which is either formed by the locking lever or by the stop element, is movable by the electromagnet in a direction forming an angle greater than about 45?, preferably greater than about 65?, with a flat plane extending at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the handle shaft. A more reliable locking and unlocking of the handle shaft can be produced.
