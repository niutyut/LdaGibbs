title: Temperature-programmed desorbed gas analyzing apparatus

abstract: 
A temperature-programmed desorbed gas analyzing apparatus including a sample chamber  in which a sample S is disposed, an infrared heating furnace  for heating the sample S disposed in the sample chamber  a measuring chamber  in which gas desorbed from the sample S by heating is introduced, a turbo molecular pump  for reducing the pressure in the measuring chamber  a mass spectrometer  having a gas detection portion disposed in the measuring chamber  an intermediate pressure-reduced chamber  provided between the sample chamber  and the measuring chamber  a first orifice  which the intermediate pressure-reduced chamber  and the sample chamber  intercommunicate with each other, and a second orifice  through which the intermediate pressure-reduced chamber  and the measuring chamber  intercommunicate with each other, and the desorbed gas occurring in the sample chamber  is introduced through the first orifice  the intermediate pressure-reduced chamber  and the second orifice  into the measuring chamber  The pressure in the intermediate pressure-reduced chamber  or the measuring chamber  is controlled by pressure adjusting unit so as to be fixed.
