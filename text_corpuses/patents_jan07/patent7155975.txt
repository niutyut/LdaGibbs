title: Composite sensor for detecting angular velocity and acceleration

abstract: 
A high-reliability complex sensor is protected against vibration and electromagnetic wave noise from outside. A shield case is provided with a power conjunction terminal, GND conjunction terminal, angular velocity conjunction terminal, X axis acceleration conjunction terminal and Y axis acceleration conjunction terminal. Both a power supply terminal of an angular velocity detection device and a power supply terminal of an acceleration detection device are electrically connected with a power connector terminal of a protection case, via the power conjunction terminal of the shield case. Both a GND terminal of the angular velocity detection device and a GND terminal of the acceleration detection device are electrically connected with a GND connector terminal of the protection case, via the GND conjunction terminal of the shield case. A circuit board is contained completely within the shield case.
