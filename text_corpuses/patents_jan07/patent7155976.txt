title: Rotation sensing apparatus and method for manufacturing the same

abstract: 
The invention provides a rotation sensing apparatus and method for manufacturing the same, in which the rotation sensing apparatus comprises at least a pair of vibration parts and a sensing electrode. The pair of vibration parts is disposed on a substrate symmetrically and each vibration part comprises an electrostatic vibrating body, a fixed support and an elastic body. The electrostatic vibrating body is away from the substrate with an appropriate distance. The fixed support connects with the electrostatic vibrating body and the substrate. The elastic body connects the fixed support with some rods thereof and connects with the electrostatic vibrating body with some other rods thereof. The sensing electrode is disposed on the substrate and under the at least pair of vibration parts. The pair of vibration parts can vibrate horizontally by electrostatic force and will sway vertically to the substrate by Coriolis force when a rotation occurs. The rotation can be measured by detecting the change of capacitance between the electrostatic vibrating body and the sensing electrode.
