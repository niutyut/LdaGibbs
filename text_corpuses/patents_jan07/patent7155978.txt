title: Micro angular rate sensor

abstract: 
A micro angular rate-sensing device is provided. A vibrator, having a plurality of proof masses connected to a ring, is arranged in a first base. Flexible supporting members connect to the vibrator to suspend the vibrator in the first base. Electrodes drive the vibrator to oscillate and control the oscillation mode of the vibrator in driving mode. Planar electrodes are arranged relative to the proof masses on a second base. The motion of the proof masses relative to the planar electrodes is sensed through the capacitance between the proof masses and the planar electrodes. The resonant structure with greater mass of the device generates greater Coriolis force and increases the sensing area. Thus, the intensity of sensed signals and noise-signal ratio are greatly increased. Furthermore, the device does not rely much on high aspect ratio manufacturing technology. Thus the manufacturing cost is reduced and the yield rate is increased.
