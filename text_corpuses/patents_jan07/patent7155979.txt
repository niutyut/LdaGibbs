title: Self-calibrating oversampling electromechanical modulator and self-calibration method

abstract: 
An oversampling electromechanical modulator, including a micro-electromechanical sensor which has a first sensing capacitance and a second sensing capacitance and supplies an analog quantity correlated to the first sensing capacitance and to the second sensing capacitance; a converter stage, which supplies a first numeric signal and a second numeric signal that are correlated to the analog quantity; and a first feedback control circuit for controlling the micro-electromechanical sensor, which supplies an electrical actuation quantity correlated to the second numeric signal. The electromechanical modulator moreover includes a second feedback control circuit for calibrating the micro-electromechanical sensor, which includes an offset-sensing circuit that can be activated by the first numeric signal, and a programmable calibration circuit, having a programmable calibration capacitance, which is connected to the micro-electromechanical sensor and is controlled by the offset-sensing circuit for balancing of the first sensing capacitance and second sensing capacitance.
