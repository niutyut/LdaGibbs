title: Testing apparatus for compression and shear testing of a test component such as a curved aircraft component

abstract: 
A testing apparatus receives a test component between a force introduction table and a pressure plate, which apply a compressive load to the component therebetween. First and second shear beams are secured to opposite vertical edges of the component to respectively introduce upwardly and downwardly directed shear forces into the component. The upwardly directed shear force is generated by a first hydraulic cylinder that is arranged above the pressure plate in a horizontally adjustable manner on a head frame, and that is connected to the first shear beam through two tension rod assemblies including tensile force measuring transducers. The downwardly directed shear force is generated by two second hydraulic cylinders that are arranged under the pressure plate and that are connected to the second shear beam by strut assemblies including compressive force measuring transducers. High shear loads can be applied in the same vertical plane as the compressive load.
