title: Method and apparatus for testing the structural integrity of offshore lifting containers

abstract: 
An apparatus and method for load testing lifting containers and their related cable slings using a hydraulic jacking arrangement located within the container itself for equalized stress loading of the container and its cable slings and lifting eyes or points under various prescribed conditions. The apparatus being portable and expandable to accommodate various size containers, applies isometric loading throughout the structural containment without lifting the container off the deck or inducing external heavy loads. The jacking arrangement includes a structural frame assembly including adjustable frame legs or vertical columns, an optional extendable screw jack and a hydraulic ram to which cable slings are attached. Actuating the hydraulic ram applies tension to the cable slings and simultaneously to the frame legs or vertical columns straddling the container and inserted within the forklift slots or openings of the container skid in an opposing manner.
