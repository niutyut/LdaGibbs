title: Dual air particle sample cassette

abstract: 
An air particle sample cassette enables concurrent or sequential collection of air particle samples. The dual air particle sample cassette has top and bottom covers that fit together to provide an airtight seal between them. The airtight seal may be provided by adhesive or otherwise. However, a close fit between the two also aids in obtaining an airtight seal. The top cover has tapering inlets circumscribed by channels. The inlets taper to create increased air speed at the exit slit of the inlets. The inlets have rounded tops for greater collection of air and the circumscribing channels provide means by which plastic caps or otherwise may be used to protect the inlets from collecting air until desired. The sample plate or collecting slide is fitted to the bottom of the top cover and obstructs the direct flow of air to the exit port. The collecting slide is protected from contact with other cassette elements by spacers or sidewalls which generally leave the corners of the bottom cover open. The exit port enables the common application of vacuum pressure to draw air through the inlets. Different inlet characteristics or air speeds may serve to enable selection of size of the particle sampled. Filter elements may also be introduced upstream of the inlets to further select sample particle size.
