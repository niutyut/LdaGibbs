title: Driving force transmission mechanism and damper apparatus equipped with driving force transmission mechanism

abstract: 
A driving force transmission mechanism having a following rotation preventing mechanism that prevents a follower wheel from rotating together with a driving wheel in a play section is provided. Also, a damper apparatus that can drive two open-close plates independently from each other through the driving force transmission mechanism are provided. The following rotation preventing mechanism includes a cam member that rotates together with the follower wheel, and an elastic member that elastically presses a cam surface of the cam member. The cam surface has an arcuate section that slides against the elastic member in a linked movement section in which the follower wheel follows rotations of the driving wheel, small diameter sections on both sides of the arcuate section, and ridge sections that continuously connects the small diameter sections and the arcuate section without forming step differences. The following rotation of the follower wheel is prevented by a load that is generated as an abutting position between the elastic member and the cam surface shifts from the smaller diameter section past the ridge section into the arcuate section.
