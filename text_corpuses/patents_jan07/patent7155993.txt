title: Dual clutch transmission having a synchronizer actuation interlock circuit

abstract: 
A dual clutch transmission for a motor vehicle having a synchronizer actuation interlock system includes two input shafts, a counter shaft, and a plurality of gear sets rotatively disposed on the shafts. The gear sets are adapted to be operatively engaged to and disengaged from their respective shafts. A plurality of synchronizers are disposed about the gear sets and the synchronizers are adapted to operatively engage and disengage the gear sets to and from their respective shafts. A plurality of hydraulically actuated shift actuators are each operatively connected to one of the plurality of synchronizers. Each shift actuator is adapted to cause its respective synchronizer to engage and disengage its respective gear sets to and from their respective shaft and further adapted to provide a hydraulic interlock that prevents an associated shift actuator on the same shaft from hydraulically actuating when the shift actuator is already engaged.
