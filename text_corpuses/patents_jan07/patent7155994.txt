title: Six-gear or seven-gear dual-clutch transmission

abstract: 
A six-gear or seven-gear dual-clutch transmission () comprising two clutches (K) the input sides of which are connected with one drive shaft () of a prime mover and the output sides with each one of two input shafts () disposed coaxially to each other, two countershafts () upon which gear wheels designed as idler wheels are rotatably supported, gear wheels designed upon input shaft () and in tooth contact with idler wheels (), coupling devices () non-rotatably and axially movably supported on both countershafts (), and movable via setting devices and one output gear wheel () on a respective countershaft () which are in tooth contact with a toothing () on one differential transmission (). To shorten the length and reduce the multiplicity of parts, the six-gear and seven-gear transmission () are designed so that upon one input shaft () two fixed wheels () and upon the other input shaft () at least one other fixed wheel () are situated for respectively driving two idler wheels ( and ).
