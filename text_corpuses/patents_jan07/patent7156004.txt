title: Adjustable wrench for removal of vehicle oil filters

abstract: 
An adjustable wrench for gripping and rotation of a generally cylindrical canister, such as an oil filter canister, includes handles which are pivotally connected to each other for rotation about a first axis. Each handle is also connected by an articulatable joint to a gripping jaw that may be positioned about the canister or body, to thereby alter the angle of the handles with respect to the jaws in order to enable use of the tool in confined spaces.
