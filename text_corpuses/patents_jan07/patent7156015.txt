title: Baler

abstract: 
A combined baler/bale wrapper () comprises a chassis () on which a baler () and a bale wrapper () are mounted. The baler () comprises a stationary segment (), a lower segment () and an upper segment () all of which carry bale forming rollers () which define a bale forming chamber () within which a round bale () is formed. The lower segment () and the upper segment () are pivotal about first and second pivot axes (), respectively from a bale forming position (FIG. ) to a discharge position (FIG. ) for transferring a bale upwardly rearwardly from of the bale forming chamber () directly onto first and second bale supporting rollers () of the bale wrapper (). The bale supporting rollers () rotate the bale () about a first wrapping axis () while a carrier ring () simultaneously revolves a pair of wrapping material dispensers () about a second horizontal wrapping axis () for dispensing wrapping material onto the bale () for wrapping thereof. The combined baler/bale wrapper is efficient, compact and of minimum length.
