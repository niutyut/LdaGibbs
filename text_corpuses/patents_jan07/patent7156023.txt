title: Method for installing an ignition system, and ignition system

abstract: 
When an ignition system is installed, the spatial position of an ignition device (to ) in relation to the surrounding, its geographical position, is as yet not determined. The user is required to exercise extreme caution in order to ensure that the ignition devices (to ) connect to the ignition system () in accordance with a predetermined blasting plan. A specially trained person must therefore systematically carry out the sequential connection (compulsory sequence) of each ignition device (to ) to the bus line () of the ignition system. i.e. logging. The person connecting the ignition devices must execute the ignition of device programming operation in all kinds of conditions, in open country, with utmost caution. This represents a considerable time delay for a blast. If one ignition device is overlooked during logging, the already entered data have to be reprogrammed, which costs time. The invention provides that the geographical position (to ) of an ignition device (to ) is determined using a satellite-assisted navigation system (GPS) () and this position is conveyed to the logger ().
