title: Method for controlling the burning pressure in a preinflator, preinflator per se and hybrid gas generator incorporating such a preinflator

abstract: 
The present invention relates to a method and a device for making the combustion of a pyrotechnic compostion independent of the ambient temperature when combusting a pyrotechnic composition in a preinflator or combustion chamber () incorporating outlets but being otherwise enclosed. As claimed in the present invention this is enabled by controlling the burning pressure of the pyrotechnic composition so that it does not exceed a predetermined value. The characteristic feature of the present invention is that the preinflator (), in which combustion of the pyrotechnic composition takes place, incorporates a plurality of gas discharge perforations () or outlets, each of which is initially sealed by a bursting disc or foil seal () that is designed to rupture when the said burning pressure in the combustion chamber () is exceeded.
