title: Minimum till seeding knife

abstract: 
The present invention relates to a knife for and a method of zero till or minimum till seeding and fertilizing. The knife is particularly adapted for dry land conditions producing minimum solid disturbance and very shallow operation. The knife has a high penetration angle preferably of 45 degrees which permits the blade to enter high trash surface cover with little tendency to plug due to trash accumulation. The blade has a forward angle of attack, the lower cutting edge advancing before the upper cutting edge, serving to make a clean cut in the soil surface without accumulating trash. Seed and/or fertilizer conduits are attached to or incorporated in the trailing face of the blade in which the outlets may be spaced for controlled placement of the materials. By the method a furrow is cut having a substantial transverse component in an operation with a substantial forward component. A preferred embodiment includes a horizontal extension blade for cutting a horizontal swath at a shallow depth through weed growth. Conduits may be secured to the extension to allow greater separation and control of material placement. The knives may be arranged in overlapping configuration on the draw bar to affect weed cutting, seeding and fertilizing of a complete with of soil in a single pass.
