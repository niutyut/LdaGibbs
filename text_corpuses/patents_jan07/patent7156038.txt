title: Frame for attachment to a dock structure having means to receive containers

abstract: 
A frame adapted to receive containers, particularly empty plastic beverage containers, such as two-liter plastic pop bottles, and adapted to be attached to a dock structure. When the dock structure, frame and bottles are in mutual cooperation, the containers provide buoyancy to the dock structure. The containers are preferably screwed into the frame and may be removed.
