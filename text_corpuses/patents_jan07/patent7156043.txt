title: Boat and method for manufacturing using resin transfer molding

abstract: 
One aspect of the present invention relates to a method for making a boat. The boat includes a port side positioned opposite from a starboard side. The boat also includes a floor and stingers supports positioned within the hull. The method includes providing a insert having two spaced-apart elongated portions interconnected by at least two spaced-apart transverse portions that extend between the elongated portions. The elongated portions are sized and relatively positioned for one of the elongated portions to extend along the port side of the hull and the other of the elongated portions to extend along the starboard side of the hull. The method also includes positioning the insert in a chamber defined between a male mold piece and a female mold piece. The method further includes providing fibrous reinforcing material that surrounds the insert within the chamber. The fibrous reinforcing material includes portions positioned between the male mold piece and the insert, and also includes portions positioned between the female mold piece and the insert. The method further includes transferring resin into the chamber between the male and female mold pieces such that the resin envelops the fibrous reinforcing material, and curing the resin within the chamber. As the resin cures, the resin enveloped fibrous reinforcing material hardens to form the hull, the floor and the support stringers of the boat.
