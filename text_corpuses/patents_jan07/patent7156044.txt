title: Antenna-mounted sign for vehicles

abstract: 
An apparatus conjoinable to a vehicle antenna includes an anchor section formed from STYROFOAM (polystyrene) and provided with a vertically registered sleeve extending along a longitudinal axis. The sleeve extends upwardly from a bottom surface of the anchor and terminates subjacent to a top surface thereof. Coextensively shaped wing sections are conjoinable with the anchor section and equidistantly spaced about an outer surface thereof. A mechanism is included for positioning the apparatus about the vehicle antenna and allows for free rotation thereof in the wind. The apparatus positioning mechanism is disposed within the anchor section and is sized and shaped so that the anchor section can be maintained at a stable position during operating conditions. The apparatus positioning mechanism is formed from non-corrosive material.
