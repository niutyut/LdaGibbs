title: Release mechanism to interact with biota, in particular fauna that may outgrow available habitat

abstract: 
A device for interacting with biota either on a pre-specified schedule or via actuation by remote signal. Preferably, the biota are fauna and more particularly fish. In selected embodiments, it comprises frangible packaging enclosing means for timing interaction, at least part of the means for programming the device and means for opening the packaging. In select embodiments of the present invention, the apparatus is inserted in fish. Specific examples of the present invention are implanted in triploid grass carp () to facilitate control of aquatic weeds in bodies of water. When the carp have been in the water for a pre-specified period or, alternatively, long enough to effectively control the target aquatic plants, toxins in the device are dispensed to kill them. Otherwise, the carp may destroy all vegetation and harm the aquatic environment for other aquatic life.
