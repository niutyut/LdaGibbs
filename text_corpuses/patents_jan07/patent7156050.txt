title: Manually folded birdhouse

abstract: 
Precut, production blank components can be folded manually to form a birdhouse without the need for tools or other aids in assembly, even where the blank components are manufactured from metal, rigid plastic or the like. The precut blank components include a one-piece main panel and a detached panel. The one-piece panel includes a rear section, a base section, first and second side sections, and a top section. Each section includes precut slots, tabs and hinges that act as folding guides, allowing the blank to easily fold into a structure defining an enclosure like the birdhouse. The detached panel then is mounted to the so constructed main panel to cover the enclosure and thereby complete the birdhouse.
