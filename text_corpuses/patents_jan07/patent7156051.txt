title: Method for enhancing poultry production

abstract: 
A method is provided for raising poultry, such as chickens, for food production. In a first preferred embodiment, the method includes the steps of: providing a facility for housing the poultry, providing at least one light-absorbing ventilation fan associated with the facility for ventilating the facility, exposing an interior of the facility to natural light cycles of an outside environment for a first period and regulating light cycles of the interior for a second period, thereby mimicking daylight duration variation representative of seasonal changes for stimulating sexual development of the poultry. In a second preferred embodiment, the method includes the steps of: providing a facility for housing the poultry, providing at least one light-absorbing ventilation fan associated with the facility for ventilating the facility, limiting exposure of an interior of the facility to light to produce a brown-out effect therein for enhancing physical development of the poultry.
