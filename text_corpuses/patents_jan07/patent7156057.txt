title: Electromagnetic actuator for controlling a valve of an internal combustion engine and internal combustion engine equipped with such an actuator

abstract: 
The present invention pertains to an electromechanical actuator controlling a valve of an internal combustion engine by means of a first magnetic field, generated in a variable manner by an electromagnet, and a second magnetic field, generated by at least one magnet associated with the electromagnet. According to the present invention, the actuator is characterized in that it comprises at least one connecting part forming a magnetic circuit facilitating the passage of the flux generated by the electromagnet for part of the field generated by the magnet, the connecting part being magnetically saturated by the partial field of the magnet.
