title: Trigger circuit for an engine starter relay

abstract: 
A trigger circuit for an engine starter relay includes: (a) a switching device for switching an output of the engine starter relay to a reference potential and for activating the engine starter relay as a function of a trigger signal, which is applied to a trigger input of the switching device; (b) a first logic circuit for the logical linking of a first digital signal of a computer device and a second digital signal of an operating device; (c) a second logic circuit for logically linking the output signal of the first logic circuit with the first digital signal; and a storage device for temporarily storing the state at the outputs of the first and second logic circuit, an output of the storage device being connected with the trigger input of the switching device, the activation of an engine starter relay being ensured in the event that the supply voltage at a computer device falls below a specified value with the result of activating a reset signal.
