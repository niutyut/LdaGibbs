title: Apparatus and method for conducting oil within a motorcycle frame space

abstract: 
An apparatus and method for laterally conducting oil within a motorcycle frame space, the motorcycle frame space being longitudinally bounded by an engine having a protrusion, the space being oppositely laterally bounded by an oil filter manifold having a removably attached oil filter, the apparatus including a bushing fitted for oil filter passage and for nesting receipt of an annular bearing surface of the manifold; the apparatus further including an oil sluice and a wholly formed joint interconnecting the sluice and the bushing, the joint orienting the oil sluice so that the oil catch and oil drain ends of the oil sluice may respectively underlie the oil filter and extend laterally from the frame space; the method including steps of extending the bushing into the motorcycle frame space and over the oil filter for nestingly receiving the manifold's bearing surface within the bushing; removing the oil filter; and catching and laterally conducting the oil along the oil sluice for collection outside the frame space.
