title: Method for auto-ignition operation and computer readable storage device for use with an internal combustion engine

abstract: 
An internal combustion engine that can be operated in compression ignition mode, comprising a fuel injector () for each cylinder; a fuel injection control unit () for controlling fuel injection quantity and a piston () in each cylinder whose compression action causes a mixture of air and fuel to be ignited. The engine is further provided with inlet and outlet valves () and sensors () for measuring various engine operating parameters, is disclosed. During compression ignition mode, the control unit controls the fuel injector to perform a first fuel injection before, and a second fuel injection after top dead center of the piston stroke during or after a negative valve overlap period. A method for operating the engine and a computer readable storage device () having stored therein data representing instructions executable by a computer to implement a compression ignition for an internal combustion engine is also described.
