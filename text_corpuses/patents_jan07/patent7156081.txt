title: Fuel conditioning assembly

abstract: 
A fuel conditioning assembly having an elongated housing with an inlet, an outlet, and a flow through passage there between. The inlet is coupled with a fuel supply so as to receive fuel flow there through into the flow through passage, wherein a turbulent flow of the fuel is initiated and the fuel is influenced by a combination of elements, in compound or elemental form, some of which are maintained in a select location within the flow through passage by a binding element. These elements may include copper, aluminum, stainless steel, titanium, magnesium, barium, calcium, iron, zirconium, cerium, platinum, and/or palladium which chemically condition the fuel flowing through the flow through passage by rearranging the molecular bonds of the fuel with a catalytic effect. The fuel, regardless of its type is dispersed into very small droplets having high surface areas thereby lowering the vapor density of the fuel and substantially increasing a fuel burn efficiency. Further, the reaction of a variety of these elements, at least with one another, serves to create an electrostatic charge that is conveyed through the flow through passage by an elongate segment and causes fuel molecules to repel one another resulting in the aforementioned catalytic effect and conditioning of the fuel as it passes through the outlet into to any of a variety of fuel combustion assemblies.
