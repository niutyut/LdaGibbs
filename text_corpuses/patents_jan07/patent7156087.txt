title: Outdoor multi-method cooker

abstract: 
An outdoor multi-method cooker for preparing a wide variety of different foods at the same time using selective convection, radiant, or conduction cooking operations with or without smoke, or combinations thereof, using a single heat source. The cooker has a horizontal central longitudinal chamber with a firebox at one end and a pair of stacks at the opposed end, a main oven, a pair of lateral smokeless ovens, a warming compartment, and a griddle above the firebox, all disposed transversely on the longitudinal chamber in parallel spaced relation, and a steam table along the upper portion of the longitudinal chamber. The cooker operates on the principle of equalization of natural differential pressures caused by rising warmer air, similar to the draw created by the upper portion of a fireplace, for drafting hot gases or smoke laden hot gases from the combustion source and selectively routing it through passageways into and around the various components.
