title: Emergency air supply worn as normal apparel

abstract: 
Provides an emergency air supply system that is worn around the arm, presumably the wrist, and intended for use in air restrictive emergency conditions. Primarily it has been designed for the need to improve safety for water recreation or water sports where an individual is often caught gasping for air. This device is purposely designed to be no more obtrusive than a piece of clothing, such as a bathing suit, or a watch band would be, in order that it does not unduly restrict the water activity or water sport or any other potentially air restrictive activity you may engage in. The design is intended to encourage usage and increase safety, by way of its structural design that uses the strap-band itself as the mechanical structure of the entire mechanism. Thus creating a unique compact design, that is convenient to wear and provides air when you most need it.
