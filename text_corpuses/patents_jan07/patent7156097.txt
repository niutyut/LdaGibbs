title: Nasal cannula

abstract: 
An improved nasal cannula and cannula support structure. In a preferred embodiment, an integrated nasal cannula and cannula support device comprise a semi-rigid mono-lumen cannula design comprising a generally L-shaped mono-lumen strut terminating at its distal end with an oxygen supply barrel. In an alternate embodiment of the present invention designed for use with conventional delivery tube pair cannula designs, a nasal cannula support device includes a ridge pole retainer comprising a generally L-shaped strut having a long leg and a short leg. The cannula support is anchored to the wearer's nose and/or forehead such that the cannula delivery tubes and supply barrel are maintained in fixed alignment regardless of the wearer's head motion.
