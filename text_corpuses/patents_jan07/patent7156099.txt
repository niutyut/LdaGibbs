title: Nostril filtering system

abstract: 
A nostril filtering system is described for providing clean, filtered air for breathing in through the nose. The filtering system includes a soft, pliable filter material held in a flexible frame that can be inserted into each nostril of a user. In the case of foul odors or noxious fumes, for example, the filter can include an activated charcoal filter portion. The device can be offered in several sizes to accommodate adults and children.
