title: Laryngeal mask airway device

abstract: 
A modified laryngeal mask airway device (LMA-device) is provided with means to improve ease of insertion, reliability of function and higher seal pressure (i.e., cuff pressure ratio). The LMA-device includes an indented section of the airway tube to offer locating means and purchase for the inserting finger, and extended mask aperture bars to increase the effective ventilating area of the mask and reduce the possibility of epiglottis displacement occasioned by mask insertion. The LMA-device further includes a modification of the airway tube angle of attachment to the mask, and provision of a posterior or back-cushion covering the entire posterior surface of the mask.
