title: Methods of implanting an intraocular lens

abstract: 
A method of restoring the vision of an eye having an impaired lens with an artificial lens implant includes replacing the lens by a polymerizable material injected into the emptied lens capsule and thereby providing a new lens implant with a predetermined refractive value, while admitting the possibility of controlling and adjusting the refractive value of the eye during the surgical process.
