title: Bead, a tool and a method for applying the bead to hair

abstract: 
A bead, a tool and a method are provided for applying the bead to hair. The bead may be constructed from a pliant and/or soft and/or resilient material, such as for example, rubber, foam, or the like. The bead may be placed around the tool which may hold one or more strands of the hair in a position for placement of the bead onto the hair. The bead may then be moved along a body of the tool until the bead is placed onto the strands of hair. The pliancy and/or softness and/or resiliency of the bead may enable the bead to be worn adjacent to the scalp without causing discomfort to a user. The bead may also be worn by a user during activities, such as, for example, running or like activity.
