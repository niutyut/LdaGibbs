title: Multifunction dental cleaning device

abstract: 
A multifunction dental cleaning device is disclosed. The device includes a housing and a drive mechanism disposed within the housing. The drive mechanism includes a driven gear having eccentrically disposed thereon a pin. A reciprocator is coupled to the drive mechanism and includes a U-shaped body having a bridge end and a housing end. The reciprocator further includes a reciprocating bridge slidingly disposed between a pair of supports formed at the bridge end of the reciprocator, the reciprocating bridge including a slot adapted to receive the pin. The reciprocator is rotatably attached to the housing at the bridge end for rotation between a vertical mode motion position and the horizontal mode motion position. A rocker arm is coupled to the reciprocator, and one of a flossing head and a brushing head are coupleable to the rocker arm. Manual rotation of the reciprocator between the vertical mode motion position and the horizontal mode motion position imparts vertical and horizontal motion of the rocker arm respectively.
