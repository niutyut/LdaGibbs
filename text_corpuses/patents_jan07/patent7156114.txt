title: Angle adjusting device for the canopy of a hang umbrella

abstract: 
An angle adjusting device for the canopy of a hang umbrella includes a cantilever divided into a left-sectional cantilever and a right-sectional cantilever, with a connecting plug inserted in between the interiors of the left-sectional and the right-sectional cantilever. The left-sectional cantilever is secured with one end of the connecting plug and the right-sectional cantilever fitted around the other end of the connecting plug by a tightening bolt. By so designing, the outer portion of the cantilever, which is connected with the canopy, can be rotated and adjusted in different angles. Thus, the canopy of the hang umbrella can be adjusted and turned forward and backward as well as leftward and rightward.
