title: Hydrant knock-off combination flow stop and backflow check valve

abstract: 
A hydrant knock-off combination flow stop valve and backflow check valve, mountable between water system riser and a wet-type hydrant having a breakaway flange ring. The vertical valve has a bulbous, cylindrical outer wall having an upper flange connecting to a wet-type hydrant by a break ring and a lower flange connecting to a system riser pipe. One embodiment has radial vertical vanes defining a central cylinder coaxial with the valve and acting as guides for a movable valve element to travel vertically up and down. The lower flange a seat, acting as a check valve with the valve element. The valve has a restraining cage keeping the valve element from engaging an upper seat. Once the break ring is ruptured the valve element seals against the seat, stopping water flow. The preferred valve element is a plastic coated ball. Another embodiment has a double mushroom, spring loaded valve element.
