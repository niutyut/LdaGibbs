title: Pipe insert and pipe assembly formed therewith

abstract: 
A synthetic resin pipe insert for insertion in an existing pipe or for use in the manufacture of new pipe to form a multi-channel pipe. The insert has a curved cross sectional configuration which defines a segment of a circle with a convexly curved radially outer wall and a concavely curved radially inner wall and a plurality of radial walls extending between the curved, radially inner and outer walls to form at least two linear channels. A curved inner pipe member may optionally be fitted against the concavely curved radially inner wall. The pipe insert of the invention facilitates multiple utility connections, such as cable TV and sewer, in a single pipe assembly.
