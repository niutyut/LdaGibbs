title: Current carrying stretch hose

abstract: 
An improved flexible hose for carrying fluids is disclosed. The hose has a first end and a second end, and is typically in a retracted position when no tensile force placed on an end of the hose and in an extended condition when a tensile force of a pulling nature is placed on an end of the hose. The hose has a thermoplastic cover on its outer surface. The thermoplastic cover has an interior surface and an exterior surface. On the interior surface there is a helical member adhered thereto this helical member being comprised of a material capable of carrying a current of electricity. The hose of the present invention stretches at least 100 percent over its at rest position when a pulling force is placed on one end of the hose.
