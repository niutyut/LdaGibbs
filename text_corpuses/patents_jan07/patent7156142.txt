title: Vertically movable partition walls

abstract: 
A partition wall, upwardly movable into storage position and downwardly movable into vertical, down position. The wall comprises a plurality of similar trains of elongated members. The members of each train are arranged to form a single pantograph forming longitudinally aligned rows of diamonds. The trains are spaced laterally to form a wall plane and oriented so that the diamonds of the pantographs operate in a plane at a 90? angle to that wall plane. A plurality of panels are provided, each panel being secured to a pair of corresponding members in adjacent trains. The panels are secured to corresponding pairs of opposed sides of the diamonds. Means are provided to raise and lower the trains at a similar rate. The pantographs are contracted when the wall is in a storage position and the elongated when the wall is in down position. The panels form a vertical wall when the pantographs are elongated in down position.
