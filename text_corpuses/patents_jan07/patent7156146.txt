title: Feeder insert having protective cap

abstract: 
A feeder insert is provided for a mold utilized for pouring metal. The insert includes a feeder body having a feed volume, in the form of an inner space, delimited by side walls and a top portion. A feed opening is provided in the base region for communicating with a hollow mold space. A domed feeder cap is displaceably disposed on a feeder body, surrounds the side walls of the feeder body to form an insulating gap, and is fixed in position relative to the feeder body prior to molding of the insert. At least one spacer of flexible material is disposed between the top portions of the feeder body and feeder cap such that during molding of the insert, and placement of the feeder body on the mold surface, due to molding pressure that occurs the feeder cap is displaceable relative to the feeder body while leaving an insulating gap between the top portions of the feeder body and feeder cap.
