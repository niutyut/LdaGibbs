title: Apparatus for steering casting belts of continuous metal-casting machines equipped with non-rotating, levitating, semi-cylindrical belt support apparatus

abstract: 
An apparatus for guiding a moving, flexible, tensed casting belt on a continuous metal casting machine along a substantially oval path. The continuous metal casting machine having an entrance-end, an exit-end and a moving-mold casting region extending from the entrance-end to the exit-end. The apparatus includes a non-rotating fluid pillow structure at the entrance end of the machine. The fluid pillow structure supports the mold-width of the casting belt. The apparatus includes two narrow shoulder-pulleys at the entrance end of the casting machine which are adjacent to opposite sides of the entrance-end fluid-pillow structure. Each pulley supports a portion of the belt outside of the moving-mold casting region. Each pulley guides the belt around the fluid-pillow structure as the belt revolves along its substantially oval path. The apparatus also facilitates the sealing, controlled-venting and recovery of pressurized fluids used to levitate the belt about a fluid-pillow structure.
