title: Manufacturing method for continuously cast product of steel

abstract: 
A manufacturing method for a continuously cast product of steel includes the steps of detecting a position of a crater end of the product by a method for measuring a solidification state of the continuously cast product using a sensor arranged so as to be in non-contact with the product, and controlling at least one condition selected from the conditions of the casting speed and the quantity of secondary cooling water based on the detected position of crater end. The method for measuring a solidification state of continuously cast product includes the steps of transmitting transverse waves of burst-like electromagnetic ultrasonic waves, in which at least one selected from frequency, amplitude, and phase is modulated within a pulse width that has a magnitude of 50 to 150% of the maximum time width not exceeding a time of flight for propagating in said product, to said product as a transmitting signal, receiving a signal after said transmitting signal propagates in said product as a receiving signal, and judging the solidification state of said product by performing a correlation operation of said receiving signal by using a reference signal of a waveform that is the same as or similar to said transmitting signal.
