title: Process for the continuous production of a think steel strip

abstract: 
A process for the continuous production of a thin steel strip, in which a steel melt from a melt reservoir is introduced onto one or more, in particular two, cooled shaping wall surfaces which move synchronously with a casting strip, in particular rotate in the form of casting rolls and at least partially solidifies at the shaping wall surface to form the casting strip. The steel melt, in terms of the crucial alloying constituents, contains less than 1% by weight of Ni and less than 1% by weight of Cr and less than 0.8% by weight, in particular less than 0.4% by weight, of C and at least 0.55% by weight of Mn. In the process, recesses are arranged on the shaping wall surface in a random pattern, distributed uniformly over the shaping wall surface, and the roll separating force (RSF) at the shaping wall surface is set to a value of between 5 and 150 N/mm, in particular between 5 and 100 N/mm.
