title: Method and device for commencing a casting process

abstract: 
To start up a casting operation in a two-roll casting device without the use of a start-up strand, the method comprises setting an operating casting thickness and rotating the casting rolls at a casting-roll circumferential velocity which corresponds to a starting casting velocity, which is lower than a steady-state operating casting velocity, feeding metal melt into a melt space formed by the rotating casting rolls and the side plates to form a cast metal strip with a substantially constant, predetermined cross-sectional format while at the same time increasing the casting velocity to a strip-forming casting velocity, then increasing the casting velocity to a strip-separating casting velocity, which is significantly higher than a casting velocity which is sufficient for the prevailing full solidification conditions, and separating off the metal strip which has been cast thus far, setting a steady-state operating casting velocity, diverting the subsequent cast metal strip to a strip-conveying device and commencing steady-state casting operation.
