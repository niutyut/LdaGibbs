title: Heating, ventilation and air conditioning system and method

abstract: 
A vehicle HVAC control system including front and rear HVAC control systems for controlling a front HVAC system and a rear HVAC system, and a method for controlling the front and rear HVAC systems. A front set point temperature is used by the front HVAC control system to control operation of the front HVAC system. The front set point temperature is communicated to the rear HVAC control system. The rear HVAC control system derives a rear set point temperature, which is based upon the front set point temperature and a temperature adjustment value, to control operation of the rear HVAC system. The temperature adjustment value is one of a plurality of predetermined temperature adjustment values that may be selected by a rear seat passenger to adjust the rear set point temperature relative to the front set point temperature and thereby permit the rear set passengers to control the temperature of air delivered to the rear seat.
