title: Inert rendering method with a nitrogen buffer

abstract: 
The invention relates to an inert rendering method for preventing and/or extinguishing fires in enclosed spaces, wherein an oxygen-inhibiting gas is introduced into the target area in order to adjust a first basic level of inertion with a reduced oxygen content in comparison with natural conditions, and wherein an oxygen-inhibiting gas is further introduced in a gradual or sudden manner (in the case of a fire) into the target area in order to adjust one or more levels of inertion with a similarly reduced oxygen content. The invention also relates to a device for carrying out the method, comprising an oxygen-measuring device in the target area and a source of an oxygen-inhibiting gas. The aim of the invention is to provide an inert rendering method and device for carrying out said method enabling the storage of extinguishing gas needed to extinguish a fire in a simple, economical manner without having to resort to premises which are normally specially provided therefor.
