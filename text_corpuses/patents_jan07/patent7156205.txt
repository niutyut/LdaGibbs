title: Step ladder safety device

abstract: 
A novel safety device for step ladders. This safety device is fabricated and positioned so as to deter, dissuade and deny the ladder user access to the unsupported top step of a step ladder while allowing the user to an aloft tool organizer for pre-loading job materials thereby eliminating the need to repeatedly climb up and down the ladder carrying materials. More people are killed doing construction work every year than in any other occupation and falls are the biggest killer of employees in the construction industry, many of these falls involve the improper use of ladders. Falls are the leading cause of death in and around the home, according to the National Safety Council, there are thousands of people die from falls around the home each year and many suffer disabling injuries many of these also involve ladders. At work or at home, these accidents invariably occur because the victims violate the basic rules of ladder safety.
