title: Quick change shock absorber

abstract: 
A quick change shock absorber for providing for the quick and easy removal of a shock absorber from a fixture of an industrial machine. The quick change shock absorber provides a housing having a smooth, outer bore and a blind bore adaptable to hold a fluid. A piston is slidably disposed within the bore of the housing and is engageable with a driver for movement between an extended position, wherein the piston has a portion extending outwardly from the housing, and a retracted position, wherein the piston is disposed within the housing. The outer periphery is receivable by the fixture which has a bore for complementarily receiving the outer periphery of the housing. A rubber retaining ring seated within a recess of the housing of the shock absorber creates a level of friction between the outer periphery of the housing and the fixture that constitutes a snug fit for quick change removal and replacement of the housing from the fixture.
