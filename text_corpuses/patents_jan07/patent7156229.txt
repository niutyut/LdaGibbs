title: Packaging device for disc-shaped items and related materials and method for packaging such discs and material

abstract: 
A packaging device is provided for retaining a disc-shaped media. In its preferred form the device comprises a lid for a container having an interior and an exterior surface, wherein the lid may be repeatedly attached to and removed from the container, preferably by means of a compression fit, and wherein the exterior surface of the lid includes a recess within which a disc-shaped media, such as a digital media disk, may be stored. In one embodiment, the disc-shaped media is first placed within a protective envelope, which envelope is then inserted into or applied to the recess and retained therein. Various means for retaining the envelope in or on the recess are contemplated, including adhesives such as fugitive glue or double-side tape, or sealing members. In an alternate embodiment, the protective envelope is not necessary, and the disc-shaped media is inserted in or applied to the recess and held therein by the same retaining means. A separate protective element may be provided to protect the media surface of the media disc. A method is further provided for packaging such disc-shaped item and other material within the packaging device.
