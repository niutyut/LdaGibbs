title: Hanging file system for CDs and DVDs

abstract: 
A hanging file system for compact disks and other small planar objects is provided. The system includes hanging file folders that are shrunken compared to standard letter sized or legal sized hanging file folders. The hanging file folder has open sides and two permanently fixed hangers. The hangers are separated by a fixed length which is less than 11 inches. An envelope can be used in conjunction with the hanging file folders to protect each compact disk stored in the hanging file folder. Thus, several CDs in their envelopes can be accommodated in each hanging file folder without risk of scratching. An identifying tab and label can be provided for each folder. A printed insert piece can be included in each folder along with compact disks. An adapter can be used to turn a standard letter or legal filing drawer into a drawer for holding at least two rows of hanging files for CDs. Alternatively, a portable container is provided sized for carrying the shrunken hanging file folders and their CDs.
