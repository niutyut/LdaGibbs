title: Stopper with guaranteed tamper-proof seal

abstract: 
A stopper incorporates a cylindrical body attachable to the edge of a container or bottle and a cover with a hinge. In the upper part of the body is incorporated a mouthpiece blockable by means of a neck of the cover. On the body of the stopper is a sealing strip joined by breakable points, wherein in-cuts are established for the retaining of corresponding projections in the cover in its closed position. The strip is provided with end wings that are positioned in depressions of the side surface of the cover, without projecting from this, the positioning of a shield of the cover in a depression of the upper edge of the sealing strip, as well as a number of vertical ribbings of the strip and the mouthpiece that are out of line with respect of the center of the stopper, with a displacement towards the sealing strip area.
