title: Overcap closures with rolled apron

abstract: 
Overcap () designed to overcap a neck () of a bottle () closed by a cork () containing a liquid to be packaged () includes a rolled skirt () and a top () fixed to the rolled skirt around a circular junction area () common to the skirt and the top. The top is formed from a first strip of material chosen to have a nature and thickness so that it can be deformed, typically by stamping between a punch and a die or by thermoforming, to form a crease-free rim around the top. The rim is formed by the peripheral part of the top axially deformed over a height H between 1 and 5 mm, and the is a rim () that extends around an arc of a circle ? varying from 45 to 90?. The rolled skirt includes an upper end () necked in over a width of at least 1 mm, cooperating with the rim to form the circular junction area, and is formed from a second strip of material () chosen such that the mechanical properties are not as good as the properties of the first material, the circular junction area () common to the rim () and to the upper end () extending over a width L equal to at least 0.5 mm.
