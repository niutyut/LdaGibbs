title: Single-piece paper cup sip adaptor

abstract: 
An adaptor enables a child to drink from a cup having a bead extending around an open end of the cup. The adaptor has an annular collar that supports the cup by engaging a lower portion of a bead of the cup around a substantial portion of a periphery of the bead. A lid is removably engageable with the collar. The lid has an annular flange depending from a lower surface toward the collar with the flange being located to abut an interior side of the wall of the cup when the lid engages the collar to form a fluid seal with the cup. The lid has a channel formed therein and located between the flange and a periphery of the lid and encircling the flange. The channel encloses an upper portion of the bead of the cup. The lid has a child drinking spout on an exterior surface of the lid adjacent a peripheral edge of the lid. The spout is in fluid communication with the cup during use of the adaptor.
