title: Self-righting sipper cup

abstract: 
A self-righting sipper cup includes an inner cup member positioned in an interior space defined by an outer cup member. The inner cup's bottom defines an outlet port. A channel connects the outlet port to a drinking slot surrounded by a drinking spout. The inner cup receives liquid, and a float rests atop the liquid. A lid attaches. A child lifts the cup by handles and drinks traditionally through the spout or sucks on the spout in either an upright or horizontal position. The float descends as liquid leaves the interior cup. If the cup drops or tips, liquid stays at the bottom of the interior cup and in the channel due to the float and a valve inside the channel. The shapes of the rounded base portion and handles, a ballast's weight, and the liquid's location bias the cup to the upright position.
