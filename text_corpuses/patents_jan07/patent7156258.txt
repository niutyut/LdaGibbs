title: Counter for counting metered doses of liquid, pastry or solid products and device for the metered dispensing of such products

abstract: 
A counter including at least one counting ring, a switch, and an actuator movable in its longitudinal axis direction. The switch includes a guide and a switching element movable in an axial and azimuthal direction relative to the guide. The guide has at least one curved surface, directing at least one projecting part disposed on the switching element. A switching cam on the switching element meshes with toothing of the counting ring. The switching device converts linear movement of the actuator into rotational movement of the counting ring. The counting ring, secured by ratchets, rotates one angular increment each actuation of the actuator. The counter is suitable for different storage containers dispensing a product portion by portion and can be configured as a daily quantity counter or a total quantity counter, for example. The counter components are inserted into each other and held together by catch elements.
