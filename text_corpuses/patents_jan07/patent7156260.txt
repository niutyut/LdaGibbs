title: Mixing module drive mechanism and dispensing system with same

abstract: 
A foam dispenser component drive mechanism which includes a foam dispenser component drive transmission comprising a crank and slide assembly, and wherein said drive transmission includes a transmission housing and the crank and slide assembly includes a crank pivotably supported by said housing and a slide assembly. The invention also features an apparatus for driving a reciprocating rod of a foam dispenser having a full retraction position and a full extension position relative to a mixing module of the dispenser, having a driver, a drive transmission system with said drive transmission system being arranged to coincide maximum rod reciprocation force application coincident with the full extension and full retraction positions of the reciprocating rod. The invention includes also a method for reciprocating a mixing module reciprocation component, including rotating a crank with a drive assembly, driving a slide assembly with the rotating crank so as to move in linear fashion, and moving the reciprocation component together with the slide assembly.
