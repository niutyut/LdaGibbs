title: Viscous fluid dispenser with smoothing blade notch

abstract: 
A viscous fluid dispenser, comprises a compressible body having a substantially tubular profile and comprising an interior fluid holding cavity and a head comprising a cap structure operatively connected to an operative end of the compressible body and a nozzle communicatively connected through the cap structure to form a continuous off-center passage through the head from the interior fluid holding cavity to an exterior fluid expressing side. A fluid dispenser package comprises a compressible body having a substantially tubular profile with a cleft within the profile extending longitudinally to the body profile from a top end of the profile to a location intermediate along the profile to form a tapering cleft within the body profile; and a head comprising a cap structure and a nozzle communicatively connected through the cap to form a continuous passage through the head from an interior fitting side to an exterior fluid expressing side, wherein the head is removably stored at the body top end in a connection reversed to an operating connection with the nozzle cradled in the cleft within the tubular profile of the flexible body. A method of applying a viscous fluid to a target area comprises positioning a compressible viscous fluid dispenser comprising an angled dispensing nozzle at an angle from a perpendicular of the dispenser to the target area and compressing the dispenser to express viscous fluid directly onto the target.
