title: Garment hanger end-clip having a stop member and method of manufacture

abstract: 
An end-clip for a garment hanger includes a bar having an end, and a connecting part with a first end and a second end. The connecting part is joined at the first end to and extends from the end of the bar. An arm is joined to the second end of the connecting part so that the arm extends over the bar and forms a space between the arm and the bar. An elongated pressing member is pivotally supported by the arm so that the pressing member is biased towards the bar by the arm and so that a part of the garment is receivable between the pressing member and the bar. The pressing member and the carrier member both have reinforced sections. A stop member is provided on at least one of the connecting part and the arm on a side facing the pressing member. The stop member is located above the pressing member at a distance so that the pressing member contacts the stop member when pivoted by inserting a garment between the pressing member and the bar.
