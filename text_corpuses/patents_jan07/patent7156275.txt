title: Welding head, welding system, method and computer program for friction stir welding

abstract: 
Welding head  for friction stir welding, adapted for connection and driving of a tool  intended for simultaneous friction stir welding from two opposite surfaces on an object for welding, comprising a tool holder , a force-generating device  and a rotary driving device  which, during operation, can impart to the connected tool  a cyclic movement around the centre axis  of the tool and relative to the object for welding arranged in conjunction with the welding head. The force-generating device is controllable during operation and adapted so as, during operation, to act between a primary shoulder  and a secondary shoulder  on a tool  connected in the tool holder . The invention also comprises a welding system for friction stir welding, with the force between the shoulders of the tool being controlled depending on the current torque for rotary driving. Also indicated are a method for initiating friction stir welding and computer program for such a method.
