title: Titanium-aluminide turbine wheel and shaft assembly, and method for making same

abstract: 
A titanium-aluminide turbine wheel () is joined to the end of a shaft () by utilizing a titanium surface on the end of the shaft to be joined to the wheel, and electron-beam welding the wheel onto the titanium surface on the shaft. A steel shaft () can have a titanium-containing end piece () mechanically joined (by brazing, bonding, or welding) to the end of the shaft, and the end piece can be directly electron-beam welded to the wheel. Alternatively, the shaft () can be formed as a titanium member and the end () of the shaft can be directly electron-beam welded to the wheel (). In another embodiment, a ferrous end piece () is mechanically joined to the titanium-aluminide turbine wheel () and then the end piece is directly electron-beam welded to the end of a steel shaft (). Alternatively, a silver-titanium alloy member () is sandwiched between the wheel () and a steel shaft () and is melted to join the parts together.
