title: Methods and systems for object identification and interaction

abstract: 
A method of facilitating an interaction between a user and a product item, the product item having an identity and the method including a number of steps. The first step involves providing the user with an interface surface associated with the product item and containing information relating to the product item. The interface surface includes coded data indicative of the identity of the product item and of a number of reference points of the interface surface. The next step involves receiving, in a computer system, indicating data from a sensing device regarding the identity of the product item and a position of the sensing device relative to the interface surface. The sensing device, when placed in an operative position relative to the interface surface, sensing the coded data in the vicinity of the sensing device and generating the indicating data using the sensed coded data. The next step involves facilitating, in the computer system and with reference to the indicating data, the interaction between the user and the product item.
