Also, a method for determining whether a mail piece has been opened including receiving mail pieces at a recipient location, receiving at an interrogator unit, such as an RFID reader, state information from the mail pieces, and transmitting the state information from the interrogator unit to a data center. In either the system or method, each mail piece may have an RFID tag that communicates with the state change element and transmits the state information to the RFID reader. Bar code or other technologies may be substituted for RFID technology.
