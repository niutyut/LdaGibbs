title: Device and method for the production and the sale of dough pieces

abstract: 
A device for the production and the sale of dough pieces comprises at least a first supply bin for keeping a pre-determined first quantity of the raw dough pieces. A first recording unit serves the recording of a customer request. A display device serves the display of a price for the recorded customer request. A payment transaction is recorded by means of a second recording unit. A baking device serves the baking of raw dough pieces pursuant to the customer's request to ready-baked dough pieces. The ready-baked dough pieces are made available in at least one supply bin that is accessible to the customer. Two delivery units serve the delivery of the raw dough pieces and/or of the ready-baked dough pieces from the first supply bin to the baking device and/or from baking device to the second supply bin. Depending upon the data recorded by the recording units, a control unit controls the delivery units and the baking device. The result is a device and a method that can be applied by means of it and operated in a cost-efficient way for the production and the sale of dough pieces.
