title: Double-sided bar code doubling as a single bar code

abstract: 
A bar code including a first linear bar code portion, and portions with two-dimensional bar codes at the ends of the first bar code portion. A separation through the first portion. The two-dimensional bar code at each end is inverted from the other end, and in an embodiment is also rotated 180?, which enable the two-dimensional bar codes on separated parts of the single bar code to be identical.
