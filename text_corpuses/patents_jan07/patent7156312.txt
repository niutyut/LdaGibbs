title: RFID tag having multiple transceivers

abstract: 
Information is communicated between an RFID tag and first and second readers. A first transceiver of the RFID tag is controlled so that the first transceiver communicates with the first reader and so that the first transceiver has substantially longer periods during which the first transceiver is not in communication with the first reader than when the first transceiver is in communication with the first reader. A second transceiver of the RFID tag is controlled so that the second transceiver communicates with the second reader at least during the periods when the first transceiver is not in communication with the first reader. The RFID tag may also have a battery, a switch coupling the battery to at least the first transceiver, and a controller that operates the switch in a duty cycle such that power is provided by the battery to the first transceiver during ON times of the duty cycle and such that power from the battery to the first transceiver is interrupted during OFF times of the duty cycle.
