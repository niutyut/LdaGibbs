title: Pay-out tube

abstract: 
A pay-out tube adapted to be used in conjunction with a capable container for directing cable from a winding disposed within the container. The pay-out tube includes a molded tube for receiving and guiding cable from the interior of the cable container and includes a surrounding wall having a series of spaced-apart ribs integrally molded into the wall and extending from the wall such that the thickness of the individual rigs exceed the thickness of the wall. Further, the pay-out tube includes a cable retainer including a surface having at least one slit formed therein that defines two sections, at least one section being deflectable and which opens in response to a cable end being inserted between the two sections, permitting the cable to move between the two sections and be held by the two sections.
