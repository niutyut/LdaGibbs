title: Method for inserting weft yarns

abstract: 
The invention relates to a method for inserting weft yarn material, comprising an insertion system in a loom. According to the invention, for every insertion the insertion system (A) is supplied with a substantial part of the weft yarn required for the insertion in a loose and substantially tension-free manner so as to be intermittently pulled off. A tubular package of adjacent windings is produced from the weft yarn material on an inner mechanical support (S) by way of an at least substantially continuous winding process and is conveyed forward in withdrawal direction. For an insertion, a number of windings that corresponds at least approximately to the weft yarn section intended to be inserted is detached or set free from the support while maintaining its tubular configuration without yarn tension. The weft yarn material is withdrawn directly inwardly from the frontmost winding and then further along the tube axis (X).
