title: Blind cord retractor

abstract: 
A cord retractor device provides multiple retracting mechanisms for independently retracting cords in each of the retracting mechanisms while operating the mechanisms in unison. The retracting mechanisms may be ganged together to form a multiple cord retraction mechanism. The retracting mechanisms may be ganged through the use of magnets, adhesives, screws or other suitable coupling agents. The cord retractor mechanism may be provided to permit the insertion of a cord externally in a retrofit option. The retractor mechanism housings may be shaped to depend upon where each mechanism is ganged together, such as in an outer or middle configuration. The ganged cord retractors contributes to preventing cord entanglement while increasing the safety of the cords in a mini blind application.
