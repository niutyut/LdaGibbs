title: Formwork system for forming transitions of reinforcement between concrete components and/or as termination of concrete formworks

abstract: 
The invention concerns a formwork system () for forming a transition of reinforcement () between a concrete component and a further concrete component located adjacent thereto in a connecting direction (), comprising two formwork elements () and a central element (), wherein the central element is disposed between the formwork elements in the region of one end of the formwork elements, and wherein elastic sealing lips () are disposed each between the formwork elements () and the central element (), which is characterized in that the formwork system comprises mounting positions () for spacers (), wherein one mounting position () each is provided on the two outer sides, of the central element, facing the formwork elements, and one mounting position () each is provided on the inner sides of the formwork elements opposite to these outer sides of the central element, several spacers can be mounted on top of each other at each mounting position, at least one spacer is mounted to each mounting position and one elastic sealing lip is disposed on at least one uppermost spacer () of each of the two opposite mounting positions. This permits production of concrete components of any wall thickness and concrete cover depth.
