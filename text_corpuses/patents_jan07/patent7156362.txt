title: Method and apparatus for forming metal contacts on a substrate

abstract: 
Solder bump pads are formed on a semiconductor substrate by way of a semiconductor template that has been micromachined to receive solder paste material. The solder paste material is then formed into precisely controlled ball shapes and geometries.
