title: Installation tool for interlocking grooved flooring panels

abstract: 
A tool includes pivotally conjoined top and bottom planar bodies being coupled along their distal edges and having opposed linear ends. The bottom body is statically registered while the top body is dynamically articulatable. Slotted brackets are coupled to one linear end of the bodies, and are slidably interlocked and repeatedly moveable between compressed and engaged positions. Knobs traverse through the top body and are engaged therewith. The knobs are adaptable between raised and lowered positions. A turn wheel is connected to the knobs for raising and lowering the knobs in sync. A handle assembly includes wheels that are seated proximal to the bodies. A lever protrudes proximally from the wheels. A mechanism is included for preventing laminate planks from sliding downwardly along the top body. Rotatable and equidistantly spaced rollers are axially oriented along the top body and are registered with corresponding ones of the knobs.
