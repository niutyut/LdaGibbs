title: Sheet feeder and image forming apparatus having the same

abstract: 
A protecting cover and a pickup device, each having a hooking portion, are rotatably provided at the flank of an image forming apparatus. The rotational centers of the protecting cover and the pickup device and the hooking portions are arranged in such geometry that the hooking portions become engaged with each other only in the range from a predetermined trace intersection to the flank of the image forming apparatus when the protecting cover is rotated from its usage position toward its retracted position at the flank of the image forming apparatus. The pickup device is stopped at the starting position of engagement where the hooking portions are positioned at the trace intersection when sheet feed is not made, and is moved to the operating position when sheet feed is to be made. The protecting cover is constructed so as to rotate in linkage with the rotation of a paper feed tray which is rotatably provided at the flank of the image forming apparatus.
