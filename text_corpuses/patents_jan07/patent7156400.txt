A seal assembly provides a rotating portion and a rotationally fixed portion. The rotating portion includes a running sleeve, a slinger segment and an upper seal segment. The slinger segment radially extends outward of the fixed portion so as to protect the fixed portion.

A seal mount segment located receives a resilient annular seal which rides upon the running sleeve and the upper seal segment.
