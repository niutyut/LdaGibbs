title: Folding scooter

abstract: 
A foldable two wheeled scooter includes a steering post with a front wheel at a lower end and handlebars at an upper end. A support tube connects with a folding mechanism enclosed in a protective housing and supportively connects with a running board having a rear wheel. The protective housing prevents a user from being harmed when moving the scooter from an upright position to a folded down position.
