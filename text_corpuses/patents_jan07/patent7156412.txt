title: Systems and methods for providing an aluminum bar for towing

abstract: 
Systems and methods for using an extrusion, forging, casting and/or machining process to provide an aluminum hitch component with increased strength that eliminates encumbrances, such as rusting and fusing, associated with traditional hitch components. Accordingly, an extruded hitch is provided that includes increased tensile strength, does not rust, is lighter, and is more appealing to consumers.
