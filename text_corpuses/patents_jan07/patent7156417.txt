An automotive seat assembly  is positioned adjacent said door assembly . A side-impact air bag assembly  is positioned within the automobile  such that the side air-bag  is deployed between the door assembly  and the automotive seat . The side-impact air bag assembly  has a deployed condition in which a side air-bag  is deployed during a collision. A laminate assembly  is in communication with the window assembly  and has an upper laminate portion  extending above the beltline  into the window opening portion  when the window assembly  is in the window closed condition . The laminate assembly  has a lower laminate portion  extending below the beltline  into the door body portion  when the window assembly  is in the window closed position .
