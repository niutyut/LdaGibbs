title: Single switch springless oven door latch assembly

abstract: 
A single switch springless motorized door latch assembly for locking an oven door in a locked and sealed position for purposes of cleaning the oven. The switch is a single pole single throw switch. A motor and cam cause a latch member to move between three different positions. In one position the latch member prevents the oven door from opening. From this position, the latch member is pulled inwardly so the oven door is in a locked and sealed position. In its locked and sealed position the door may not be opened.
