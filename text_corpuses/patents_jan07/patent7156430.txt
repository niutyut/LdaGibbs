title: Latch assembly

abstract: 
A latch assembly having a housing and a catch assembly on the housing. The catch assembly has at least one catch element that is repositionable relative to the housing to change the catch assembly between first and second different states. The catch assembly in the first state is capable of preventing a strike element engaged by the latch assembly from separating from the latch assembly. The catch assembly in the second state permits a strike element, engaged by the latch assembly with the catch assembly in the first state, to be separated from the latch assembly. The housing has a base wall defining a support for at least a part of the catch assembly, a first side wall extending angularly away from the base wall, and a return wall projecting angularly away from the first side wall. At least a part of each of the base wall, first side wall, and return wall is integrally formed to define a U-shaped portion that opens in a first direction and resists deflection of the housing in response to the application of force imparted through the catch assembly to the housing in the first direction and oppositely to the first direction.
