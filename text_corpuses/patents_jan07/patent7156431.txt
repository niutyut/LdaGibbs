title: Wedge couple for blocking-up and fixation of windows and doors

abstract: 
Wedge couple for fixing and wedging-up of windows and doors in connection with their mounting in a wall opening, and associated with mounting shears with which the wedges can be located and tightened by means of a shearing operation with one hand. The wedge couple includes two flat wedges oriented in mutually opposite directions, each with a thick end and a thin end. The thin end of one wedge is connected to the thick end of the other wedge by means of a thin deformable plate which ensures that the two wedges are correctly arranged in relation to each other and able to be displaced only parallel towards each other in their longitudinal direction, when they are being forced together.
