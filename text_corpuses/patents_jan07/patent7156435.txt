title: Snow shovel

abstract: 
Apparatus  for a shovel designed for moving snow  tangentially while the shovel moves longitudinally along the ground thereby eliminating the need for lifting the shovel during snow removal. The snow shovel of the present invention  comprises a latitudinal curved blade  with opposing end terminus arcs  of differing degrees whereby shoveled material will move from one side of the blade to the other. On the back side of the blade  are longitudinal and latitudinal ribs  forming an integral part therewith providing reinforcement terminating in a centrally disposed receptacle for a handle mounting plate . The handle mounting plate  has mating apertures  for fixedly fastening the mounting plate to the curved blade . Positioned at the apex of the handle plate  is a post  for press fitting the handle plate to the shaft. The handle grip member  also has a post  that is inserted into the opposing end of the handle shaft
