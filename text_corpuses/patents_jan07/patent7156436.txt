title: Clamping device having an actuating carriage which moves a movable jaw toward a stationary jaw

abstract: 
Camping device suitable for lifting and handling of sheet like-objects, having a rigid frame configured to straddle an edge region of sheet-like objects, the frame including a stationary jaw and a frame housing defining a gap between them in which the sheet-like object may be received, the stationary jaw providing a first clamping surface, a movable jaw supported at the frame within the gap for movement towards and away from the stationary jaw, the movable jaw providing a second clamping surface, and an actuating carriage arranged to transmit a clamping force, the carriage being located between the movable jaw and frame housing for reciprocating movement along a longitudinal axis of the device on actuator tracks present at the movable jaw and frame housing, at least a portion of one of the actuator tracks having an inclined portion devised to bias the movable jaw towards the stationary jaw as the actuator carriage is caused by the clamping force to be displaced along the inclined portion, whereby the respective clamping surfaces are brought in contact with opposite faces of the sheet-like object when received within the frame and frictionally clamp same against displacement, characterized in that the movable jaw is supported at and mounted to the frame by at least one linkage arm which is articulated or pivoted at the movable jaw and near the upper end of the frame, respectively.
