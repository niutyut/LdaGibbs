title: Automotive trim part with applique and method of making same

abstract: 
The present invention provides for an improved trim part, e.g. a bolster or trim plate, with integrated appliqu? for use in a trim assembly, and to a continuous two-shot molding operation that may be performed utilizing a single mold assembly. In an exemplary embodiment, the trim part, i.e. a bolster, includes a substrate formed by injecting a first material into a first shot mold cavity in a first shot of a molding operation. An appliqu? is provided in a second shot mold cavity then a cover is formed between the substrate and appliqu? by injecting into a mold chamber a second foamed material in a second shot of the molding operation. The formed cover is integrally molded to at least a portion of the substrate and the appliqu? to form a trim part with integrated appliqu?.
