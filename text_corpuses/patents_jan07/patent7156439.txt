title: Automotive wet trunk storage compartment with drain

abstract: 
A recessed storage well is formed in the rear load floor of an automotive vehicle to provide cargo transport capabilities for wet cargo. The recessed storage well is provided with a drain to permit the flow of liquids collected within the recessed storage well to be discharged externally of the vehicle. The recessed storage well is formed from impervious material to permit the storage of wet articles of cargo without dampening the carpet covering on the rear load floor. The drain is seated in an automotive frame component by a rubber grommet that prevents the transfer of vibrational noise to the recessed storage well. The drain enables the use of a water spray in clean-up operations by allowing the collected water to drain away from the recessed storage well.
