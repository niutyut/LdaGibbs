A tailgate counterbalancing hinge assembly includes a linear torque rod, a first end assembly and a second end assembly. One end assembly pivotally retains the tailgate while permitting the torque rod to be rigidly coupled to the tailgate for movement with the tailgate about a pivot axis. The other end assembly pivotally retains the tailgate and permits the end of the torque rod o be rigidly retained with respect to the vehicle body. The assemblies are easily mounted in the vehicle using brackets that are secured to the tailgate and a vehicle body hinge pin to simplify installation and repair of the assembly.
