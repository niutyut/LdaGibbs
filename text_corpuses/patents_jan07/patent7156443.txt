title: Golf cart seat activated safety bar device

abstract: 
A golf cart safety bar device is activated by occupied cart seats operatively installed on the cart frame to swivel about hinges and on spring biases. The safety bar device includes a pair of laterally adjacent driver/passenger seat bottoms each having a front end and a rear end. A weight is installed internally or externally of the cart frame to hold up the seat front at rest until the seating passenger depresses it. The weight means provides an eccentric weight about its own axis of rotation. A safety bar is fixed at one end to the weight means with the opposite end protruding upright at rest in preparation for a passenger to board the cart without a blocking. When passengers sit the safety bars are lowered limiting lateral outward movement of passengers from the cabin. The safety bars block the entrances or exits.
