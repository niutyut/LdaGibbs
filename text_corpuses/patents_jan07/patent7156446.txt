title: Hard-top convertible roof

abstract: 
A convertible motor vehicle first and second storage compartments extending transversely behind a seat. A rigid roof shell has two posts defining a rear opening. The first compartment extends laterally forward past the seat. Guide rails extend laterally in the first compartment forward past the seat. Respective guide slides on the rear end posts ride on the guide rails, and the roof shell is displaceable along the guide rails between an up position wholly out of the first storage compartment and a down position wholly in the first compartment with the guide slides laterally flanking the seat. A rear windshield fits in the opening between the posts. A guide in the second storage compartment displaces the rear windshield between a lowered position in the second compartment and a raised position fitting between the rear end posts of the windshield in the up position thereof and closing the rear opening.
