title: Load-bearing mounting reinforcement structure for vehicles

abstract: 
A load-bearing reinforcement structure for assisting the secure mounting of a load producing element, such as a rear-view mirror assembly, to a vehicular body is advantageously fashioned from a heat and creep resistant plastic, such as glass-reinforced Polyethylene Terephthalate. The reinforcement structure features a mounting element capable of mechanically connecting the reinforcement structure to a surface of a vehicular body, such as an internal surface of a panel of a door assembly, without the need for welding, placement fixtures or use of separate fastening elements.
