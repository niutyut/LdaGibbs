title: Stackable chair

abstract: 
A stackable chair has a backrest mounted on back supports by resilient mount units for tilting between an upright position and a tilted-back position. Each mount unit includes a rigid coupling member having a lower portion received within an upper end portion of the respective back support and pivotally joined to the respective back support and having an upper portion received within and affixed to a socket in the backrest. A compression spring received within the upper end portion of the back support and engaged between the lower portion of the coupling member and a front wall of the respective back support biases the backrest to the upright position. An armrest is slidably supported on an armrest support for simultaneous and controlled pivotal movement about a substantially vertical pivot axis of a rearward part of the armrest relative to a forward part of the armrest and translatory movement in a plane perpendicular to the pivot axis. Movements of the armrests permit dense stacking of the chairs.
