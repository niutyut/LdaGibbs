title: Two-stage cylinder for applying automatic set and release hand brake

abstract: 
An apparatus engageable with a hand brake assembly for automatically applying at least one brake secured to a railway vehicle. The apparatus comprises an operating mechanism which is a two stage pneumatic cylinder having a primary portion for initial phase of the brake application and a secondary portion for the final brake application to apply high forces and to comply with AAR requirements. A source of fluid pressure is connected to the operating mechanism for periodically supplying a predetermined pressure thereto. A first control device is connected to the source of the fluid pressure for initiating the supply of such predetermined pressure to the operating mechanism. A second control device is connected to the source of the fluid pressure for regulating the supply of such predetermined pressure to the operating mechanism thereby causing an automatic application of such brake by the hand brake assembly.
