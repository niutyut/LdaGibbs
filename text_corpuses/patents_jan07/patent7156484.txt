title: Inkjet printhead with CMOS drive circuitry close to ink supply passage

abstract: 
An inkjet printhead with nozzles  and liquid passages  leading to each nozzle. The nozzles, ejection actuators , associated drive circuitry  and liquid passage  being formed on and through a wafer  using lithographically masked etching technique, such that the wafer has a droplet ejection side and a liquid supply side. Each of the liquid passage is formed by etching a hole  partially through the wafer  from the droplet ejection side, and etching a passage from the liquid supply side of the wafer  to the hole . Etching a hole  into the wafer  from the droplet ejection side means the ink supply passage  can stop short of the interface between the dielectric  and the wafer  to prevent the etchant from tracking sideways and damaging the drive circuitry . As the inlet hole  is relatively shallow, the removal of the resist is not overly difficult. This allows the distance between the drive circuitry  and the inlet hole  to be reduced to less than 20 microns. This permits a more compact overall design and higher nozzle packing density.
