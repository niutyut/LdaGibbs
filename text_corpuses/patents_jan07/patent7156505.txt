title: Droplet ejecting apparatus

abstract: 
Since two polarizing external electrodes sandwich a portion of a sheet-stacked piezoelectric body that is located between first and second internal electrodes, that portion of the stacked piezoelectric body is polarized in a direction perpendicular to a direction in which the first and second internal electrodes are opposed to each other, when a polarizing voltage is applied to the two polarizing electrodes. Subsequently, the two polarizing electrodes are electrically connected to the second internal electrodes. Thus, the sheet-stacked piezoelectric body can be manufactured without needing to remove the polarizing electrodes. When a drive voltage is applied to the first and second internal electrodes, intermediate piezoelectric sheets of the stacked piezoelectric body are deformed in a ?shear? mode, i.e., are curved toward a pressure chamber in which ink is accommodated. Since, simultaneously, an electric field parallel to the direction of polarization of the stacked piezoelectric body is produced in an outermost piezoelectric sheet of the stacked body, the outermost sheet is elongated in the direction of stacking of the piezoelectric sheets, whereby the amount of deformation of the stacked piezoelectric body toward the pressure chamber is increased.
