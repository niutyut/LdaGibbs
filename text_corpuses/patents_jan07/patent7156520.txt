title: Color separating optical system, image display optical system, and projection image display apparatus

abstract: 
A color separating-combining optical system is configured to separate illumination light into a plurality of color spectrums, guiding these color spectrums to respective image display elements, and combining the color spectrums modulated by the image display elements. The system includes a first polarization separating optical system that reflects the first color spectrum from the separating optical system to a first image display element and transmits the first color spectrum from the first image display element to the combining optical system. Similarly, a second polarization separating optical system is provided that reflects and transmits the second color spectrum. The degree of linear polarization of a reflected color can be maintained higher than that of another, and/or an antireflection element can be included in the path of reflected light.
