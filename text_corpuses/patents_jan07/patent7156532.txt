title: Blind spot curved mirror

abstract: 
The Blind Spot Curved Mirror reflector has a constant radius curve from top to bottom, and straight from left to right sides, as a section of a cylinder. The outer shell has a section removed for installation alignment on an original equipment outer shell. The removed section form's a basic alignment for a vehicle driver's blind spot area. The blind spot curved mirror will image the same area as a larger flat mirror with a smaller profile. The smaller profile will restrict less vision area than a larger flat mirror. The blind spot curved mirror with it's outer shell may be attached to an existing side mirror as an auxiliary mirror or included in an original equipment mirror outer shell with the original flat mirror and give the same blind spot effect.
