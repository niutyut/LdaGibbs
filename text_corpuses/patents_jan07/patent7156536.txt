title: Flashlight holder for a helmet

abstract: 
A light holder for a brimmed helmet of the type worn by firefighters. The holder has an aperture for receiving the barrel of a light. A mounting slot extends angularly with respect to the aperture so when the slot is engaged with the brim, the light is maintained at eye level disposed below the brim and in an out-of-the-way position to minimize the possibility of snagging. Set screw or other fasteners may be provided for securement of the light to the holder and the holder to the helmet.
