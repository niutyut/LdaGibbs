title: Strip light shade

abstract: 
An after-market shade for a strip light, typically containing several bare bulbs, either clear or frosted. The shade is a molded mainly one-piece translucent shade, or a translucent shade with two end caps for mounting. The shade is not attached to the fixture but to the wall, or possibly ceiling, on which the strip light is mounted. The shade is typically curved or half cylindrical. Translucent sheets with decorative patterns or colors may be mounted on the inside or outside of the shade to produce decorative effects and coordinate with room decor.
