title: Light diffusive sheet and area light source element using the same

abstract: 
A light diffusive sheet of the present invention comprises a transparent polymer sheet provided with a light diffusion layer  on one side and an uneven surface having arithmetical mean deviation of 0.5 ?m or less and mean spacing of 80 ?m or narrower on the opposite side. Such an uneven surface can be made by forming a backcoat layer  including a mixture of particles having particular mean diameters in a particular proportion to a binder resin on the transparent polymer sheet. An area light source element  of the present invention is produced by laminating a prism sheet  on a light guide plate  so that the prism surface  of the prism sheet  is opposed to the light-emitting surface  of the light guide plate  and laminating the light diffusive sheet on the prism sheet  so that the uneven surface (backcoat layer) of the light diffusive sheet is opposed to the surface opposite of the prism surface. The light diffusive sheet of the present invention can prevent occurrence of a rainbow-like annular pattern without deteriorating the front luminance and view angle of the area light source even when combined with a downward-facing prism sheet.
