title: Blade driving device for use in cameras

abstract: 
A blade driving device for use in cameras of the present invention includes a base plate having an exposure aperture, an ND filter blade that is supported rotatably around a supporting shaft on the base plate and is moved to a position withdrawn from the exposure aperture and a position facing the exposure aperture, and an electromagnetic actuator that drives the ND filter blade. This electromagnetic actuator includes a frame member joined to the base plate, a rotor which has a drive pin for exerting a driving force and rotates within a predetermined angle range with one end of which being supported to the frame member and the other end of which being supported to the base plate, and an exciting coil wound around the frame member and the base plate. Therefore, the structure of the electromagnetic actuator for driving a shutter blade, a diaphragm blade, an ND filter blade or the like can be simplified and reduced in cost, and this makes it possible to reduce the size and thickness of the device.
