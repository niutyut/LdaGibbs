title: Driver for opening and closing dual-blade shutter adapted to be reset without re-opening shutter

abstract: 
In a camera, a dual-blade shutter has a pair of shutter blades supported for opening and closing movement to uncover and re-cover an exposure aperture, and a shutter driver that projects into respective overlapping slots in the shutter blades and is supported for shutter opening and closing movement. A high impact striker is movable against a strike portion on the shutter driver to initiate shutter opening movement of the shutter driver, then moves beyond the strike portion, and is returnable past the strike tab to be reset. A fixed post projects into an elongate slot in the shutter driver to support the shutter driver for shutter opening and closing movement and to allow the high impact striker to shift the shutter driver out of the way of the high impact striker so that the high impact striker can be returned past the strike tab without causing the shutter blades to be moved open.
