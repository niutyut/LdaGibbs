title: Anti-rotational traffic channeling device

abstract: 
Molded ribs are provided for use in connection with traffic channeling devices, such as drums, which employ external ballasting collars, such as molded rings or truck tire rings. The ribs are disposed at spaced intervals near the bottom of the external wall of the drum, for improving contact between the drum wall and the internal diameter of the ballasting collar, in order to eliminate undesirable separation of the drum and collar during ordinary use, and to prevent inadvertent rotation of the drum relative to the collar.
