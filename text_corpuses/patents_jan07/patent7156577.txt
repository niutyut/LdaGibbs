title: Concrete finishing tool with handle-mounted vibrating arrangement

abstract: 
A vibratory concrete finishing tool includes an elongated handle formed with a cylindrical configuration having an uppermost end and a lowermost end. A concrete working device has a planar bottom surface adapted to engage a wet concrete surface, and a receiver for removably receiving the lowermost end of the handle. A clamping and vibration transmitting arrangement is coupled externally to the lowermost end of the handle. An engine-driven vibratory mechanism is fixed to the clamping and vibration transmitting arrangement so that the vibratory mechanism is held in spaced relationship with the handle. The vibratory mechanism has a spinning crankshaft assembly with an eccentric weight mounted thereon.
