title: Interlockable drainage system

abstract: 
The specification and drawing figures describe and show an interlockable drainage system insertable into a ditch that includes two or more liner sections. Each liner section includes a plurality of corrugations that are asymmetrical. The interlockable drainage system also includes a flared channel extending from opposing edges of the liner sections. A shoulder is formed in the opposing ends of the liner sections. A plurality of bosses is formed on the shoulder. The plurality of bosses on one shoulder is compressibly connectable to the plurality of bosses on an opposing shoulder, thus connecting one liner section to another. A connector is provided for added interconnectability of the plurality of bosses.
