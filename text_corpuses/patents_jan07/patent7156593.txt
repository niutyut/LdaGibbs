An adjustable tie-down assembly includes a pin having a first end and a second end. A lock plate is disposed proximate the second end and a sliding block is partially received within an opening of a rail. The block is adapted to receive the pin. A tie-down loop is disposed proximate the first end and at least one spring member is disposed proximate the sliding block. The spring member is adapted to bias the tie-down loop in a first direction away from the sliding block and the spring member is adapted to secure the lock plate to the rail.
