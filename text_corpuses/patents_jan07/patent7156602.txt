title: Mechanism for exchanging chip-carrier plates for use in a hybrid chip-bonding machine

abstract: 
A mechanism for exchanging chip-carrier plates in a hybrid chip-bonding machine having a plurality of chip-carrier plates, a magazine to store the plurality of chip-carrier plates, and a transport arrangement having a first and second clamping device that are disposed on a movable holder is disclosed. The transport arrangement is designed to remove a selected chip-carrier plate from the magazine and deliver it to a chip processing station. After processing, the selected chip-carrier plate is removed and deposited in the magazine. Movement of the chip-carrier plates is controlled such that the selected chip-carrier plate is positioned at a collection point to be collected from the magazine. Movement of the transport arrangement holder is controlled such that the first and second clamping devices are disposed in a vertical arrangement on the holder and are constructed to individually release or grip a chip-carrier plate in a similar angular position of the holder.
