title: Substrate transport and marking assembly

abstract: 
An apparatus for transporting and marking a substrate, such as a collapsed corrugated cardboard carton. A feeder station is configured to receive a substantially vertically aligned stack of substrates. An advancement assembly of the feeder station successively moves the lower portions of the substrates in an inboard direction and a tensioner assembly applies a clamping force to the upper portions of the substrates. A transfer assembly engages the innermost substrate in the stack to rotate and remove the substrate from the rest of the stack and provide the substrate to a transport and marking station, which drives the substrate past a marking mechanism. The transport and marking station advances the substrate into a gravity discharge station which induces sufficient tilt in the substrate so that, upon exiting of the substrate from the transport, gravity induces the substrate to rotate and fall in a controlled fashion into a completed stack.
