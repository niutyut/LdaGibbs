title: Centrifugal pump with multiple inlets

abstract: 
A centrifugal pump assembly that includes an inlet housing that defines a inlet chamber and at least one inlet port in fluid communication with the inlet chamber. A volute forming part of the assembly defines an outlet port. An impeller is mounted for rotation at least partially within the volute and operative upon rotation to convey fluid from the inlet port to the outlet port. The inlet housing defines mounting structure by which the inlet housing can be secured to the volute in any one of a plurality of positions with respect to the volute so that the spatial relationship between the inlet port and the outlet port can be changed by changing the relative position of the inlet housing with respect to the volute. The inlet housing also mounts a pump insert which may be either a dedicated clean-out assembly or structure defining an axial inlet port. The inlet housing defines a mounting flange that includes a plurality of symmetrically spaced apertures and the volute includes structure that is engageable with the flange and includes a plurality of symmetrically spaced bores that are alignable with the apertures formed in the mounting flange in several relative positions. The inlet housing may also be fitted with a aperture in an inlet housing wall for defining a radial inlet port communicating directly with the inlet chamber. Alternately, the inlet housing can include a passage for communicating a spaced inlet port with the inlet chamber. The passage may be jogged. The passage should be such to make the radial inlet and the radial outlet share a common plane, perpendicular to the axis of the impeller shaft. The impeller may form part of a rotating assembly which includes a mounting structure that enables the volute to be secured to the rotating assembly in any one of several positions.
