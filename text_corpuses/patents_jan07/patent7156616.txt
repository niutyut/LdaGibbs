title: Combinative standing fan

abstract: 
A combinative standing fan includes a vertical shaft fan, a first, and a second tubular cover. The first and the second tubular cover respectively consist of a front half cover and a rear half cove. The front half covers of the two tubular covers are provided with plural wind inlets, and the rear half covers of them are provided with plural wind outlets. The first tubular cover has a guide groove in an upper end, and the second tubular cover has a bottom edge at the bottom to fit with the guide groove so the second tubular cover may rotate relative to the first one, with the guide groove and the bottom edge. When the shaft fan operates, air comes in the wind inlets of the two tubular covers and blows out of the wind outlets of them. The second tubular cover is rotatable to the first one, letting the fan blow winds in many different angles or directions simultaneously.
