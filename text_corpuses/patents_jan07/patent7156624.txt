title: Compressor sound suppression

abstract: 
A compressor has a housing. One or more working elements cooperate with the housing to define a compression path between suction and discharge locations. An intermediate port is located along the compression path. A branch path extends to the intermediate port. The compressor includes means for limiting pressure pulsations along the branch path.
