title: Double side action type reciprocating compressor

abstract: 
A double side action type reciprocating compressor is provided. The double side action type reciprocating compressor includes suction valve assemblies and discharge valve assemblies loaded in a suction passage and a discharge passage to thus control suction of fluid and respectively combined with each other so that movement direction of fluid flowing inside the suction valve assemblies and the discharge valve assemblies is vertical to the movement direction of the reciprocating motor. Accordingly, it is possible to remove the suction passage and the suction valve directly formed or loaded in the piston. Therefore, it is possible to easily process the pistons. Because the diameter and the length of the pistons can be reduced, it is possible to miniaturize the compressor. Also, because the suction valve and the discharge valve are positioned on a side surface with respect to the movement direction of the pistons, it is possible to prevent the pistons from colliding with each other and to prevent the valves from being damaged. Also, because the left and right pistons share the same compression space when the pistons are in a reciprocating motion. The forward and the backward of the pistons move keeping balance. Accordingly, the compressor stably drives regardless of movement conditions.
