title: Apparatus for encapsulating a multi-chip substrate array

abstract: 
A mold apparatus for encapsulating IC chips mounted on a substrate. In an exemplary embodiment a mold is provided with an upper mold platen having a plurality of cavities for encapsulating wire bonds and related interconnections on a first side of a multi-chip carrier substrate. The mold further includes a lower mold platen with a single cavity for encapsulating substantially the entire second chip side of the carrier substrate. Support elements are provided for supporting the multi-chip carrier substrate. The support elements are configured to prevent or minimize substrate deflection during the fill of the mold cavities with encapsulant material. The support elements may be integral to a mold cavity or may be removable. The support elements may further be aligned along lines representing a series of individual device packages. The molded assembly may then be cut along marks left in the encapsulant to define individual device packages.
