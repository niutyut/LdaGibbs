title: Device for producing filaments

abstract: 
A device for producing filaments, in particular, from a thermoplastic polymer, wherein the filaments emerge from the spinneret openings of a spinneret plate. A distribution device is provided for distributing the molten polymer being supplied over a preliminary spinning width. At least one exchangeable distribution plate with several distribution openings that are distributed over the spinning width is arranged downstream of the distribution device. The exchangeable spinneret plate is arranged downstream of the distribution plate, wherein said spinneret plate contains spinneret channels that are distributed over the final spinning width. The spinning width defined by the distribution openings is smaller or larger than the preliminary spinning width, and the preliminary spinning width can be reduced or enlarged to the final spinning width with the aid of the distribution plate. The desired final spinning width can be adjusted by exchanging the distribution plate.
