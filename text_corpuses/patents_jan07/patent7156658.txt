title: Dental measurement device

abstract: 
A dental measurement device is disclosed that includes a mouthpiece having a bracket attached thereto and extending outward therefrom. A bite registration compound is applied to the mouthpiece and the mouthpiece is positioned in a patient's oral cavity. The bracket extends outward in front of the patient's face. The bracket includes a vertically oriented planar attachment surface to which measurement devices such as planar rulers are readily attached using adhesives or mechanical fasteners. The rulers include reference markings. The rulers are positioned prior to attachment such that the reference markings align with the anterior midline and incisal edge locations of the patient. Such reference positions are then available for later use in fabricating dental restorations. Alternatively, anterior midline and incisal edge locations are identified by application of permanent markings to the rulers.
