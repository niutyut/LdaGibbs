title: Electrical contractors embedded in threaded connections

abstract: 
Tubulars for transmitting data in a wellbore and threaded connections having electrical contactors embedded therein. The threaded connection includes a first contactor embedded in electrically insulating material within a first slot formed in the pin thread. A second contactor is embedded in electrically insulating material within a second slot formed in the box thread. Upon selected make-up of the pin member with the box member, the first contactor and the second contactor are in contact such that an electrical signal can be transmitted from the box member to the pin member. The first contactor and the second contactor are isolated by at least one sealing arrangement selected from the group consisting of a thread seal, an electrical connector seal, and at least two seals on opposing sides of the first contactor and the second contactor. Methods of manufacturing and making-up a connection are also disclosed.
