title: Module connector

abstract: 
The present invention provides a module connector including a housing having four sidewalls that define a chamber for receiving a module therein. Each sidewall defines a plurality of contact recesses. A plurality of contacts is accommodated in the contact recesses and electrically contacts with the module. Pull-out prevention slices are positioned on periphery of the housing. Each pull-out prevention slice has a pressing portion which extends into the chamber and presses on the top of the module downwardly, and an actuating portion which extends upwardly from the pressing portion and is adapted for being manually pulled outward. When the module is needed to be pulled out from the module connector, by pulling the actuating portion outward, the pressing portion is driven to move outward and upwardly with the result that the pressing portion departs from the module to make way to the module for the module being pulled out. Therefore, no special tool is needed, in turn, the module is avoided being scraped.
