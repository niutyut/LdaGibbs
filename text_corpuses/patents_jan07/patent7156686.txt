title: Insulation displacement connection splice connector

abstract: 
A splice connector includes a first IDC terminal, a second IDC terminal, a body receiving the first and second IDC terminals, and a cover connected to the body such that the cover selectively slides with respect to the body in the first linear direction from first position to a second position. The body defines a first seat configured to receive an associated first cable and second seat configured to receive an associated second cable that is to be electrically connected to the associated first cable. The first and second IDC terminals each include a portion that extends into a region adjacent a respective wire seat. The cover is configured to cooperate with the body where a portion of the cover engages a portion of the body at a third position between the first position and the second position such that in the third position movement of the cover with respect to the body in a second direction, which is opposite the first, is inhibited.
