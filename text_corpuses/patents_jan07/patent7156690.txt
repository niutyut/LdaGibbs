title: Extruded connector without channel insulating layer

abstract: 
An extruded metal connector that does not require an insulating layer in the channels is disclosed. Further an extruded metal connector that does not require and IPCB is also disclosed. The connector includes a metallic extruded housing having one or more connector channels formed therein during extrusion. The one or more connector channels have first and second ends and channel walls. The connector also includes a singular or plurality of pin guides each with a central aperture and each operatively coupled to a corresponding channel. An intermediate printed circuit board (IPCB) or other such member having one or more spaced apart first electrical contact pins serves to hold the connector pins within the connector channels and away from the channel walls by the IPCB at the first end of the channel. Pin guides arranged at the other ends of the channel support the ends of the contact pins opposite on the opposite end so that the pins remain in the center of each channel and away from the channel walls when no IPCB is used.
