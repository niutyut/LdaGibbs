title: Eye grounding controller

abstract: 
A lifting and anti torque lifting means to be attached to a clamp or other end termination of a temporary conductor. In power distribution services the most common use of such a temporary conductor is a grounding set which is used to provide a conductive path between power lines as a safety ground. The lifting means may be a separate retro fit assembly or may be made integral with grounding clamps or other end terminations. The lifting means allows the grounding clamp to be lifted into position with relatively light extendable long reach poles commonly used by lineman. The anti torque feature helps resist the tendency for the end terminations to cam off the line or other object the clamp has been placed on while the clamp is closed or opened. A second hook attached to the conductor proximate to a first end termination cooperates with a first hook of the lifting means in order to hang other end terminations of the conductor set. These features increases convenience and safety by having the second end termination controlled and proximate to the first end termination while lifting and positioning the first end. A key hole slot at the top of the aperture helps keep the assembly on a ball end L hook commonly used by lineman on extension sticks. Another variation is a L slot connected to the aperture which allows a downward pull to be exerted to lock spring type jaw end terminations and helps secure the assemble on the extension stick.
