title: Electrical connector

abstract: 
An electrical connector for use between two devices having conductive regions between which an electrical connection is to be formed, the electrical connection comprising, a housing including a passage therethrough, a conductive element of an elongate conductive material disposed within the passage. The conductive element is formed to define an upper contact region and a lower contact region for engagement to an upper the device and a lower the device respectively. Also provided are a location region which secures the conductive element to the housing, a beam region including a first end dependent from the location region and a free end at or towards which the upper contact region is located. The beam is resiliently deflectable to a position wherein the upper device is positioned for use having the upper contact region pressed thereto and wherein the upper contact is biased towards the first position. A fulcrum providing region is positioned. to become engaged with the beam at a region thereof between the first end and the upper contact region during engagement of the upper device prior to the upper contact region reaching the second position.
