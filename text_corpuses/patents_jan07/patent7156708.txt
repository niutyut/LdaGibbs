title: Marine steering assembly with integrated pivot pin

abstract: 
There is provided a hydraulic steering assembly for applying a force to a tiller of a marine, outboard propulsion unit. The steering assembly comprises a hydraulic steering actuator including a cylinder and an elongated piston rods. A pivot member is pivotally mounted on the tiller of the propulsion unit for pivoting about a first link axis which is parallel to the steering axis. There is a pair of actuator arms, each actuator arm being connected to the cylinder and having a portion extending radially outwards with respect to the piston rod axis. Each actuator arm includes an integral cylindrical projection. The pivot member has a complementary cylindrical recess for each integral cylindrical projection and the pivot member thereby rotatably receives each cylindrical projection. Preferably, each cylindrical projection and actuator arm comprise one piece. At least one of the actuator arms is removable.
