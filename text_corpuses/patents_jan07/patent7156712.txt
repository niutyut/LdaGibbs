title: Floating debris and weedline marker

abstract: 
A marker for marking debris, weed lines and/or other objects floating in a body of water. The marker can consist of a tube, such as a plastic tube having a weighted end such that the marker floats upright in the ocean. Preferably, the marker is coated with a fluorescent color such as the color orange or other highly visible coloring. A reflective strip of material can also be disposed at the end (non-weighted end) of the marker which extends out of the water. A loop can be provided at the non-weighted end of the marker such that the marker can be retrieved by a gaff, boat hook, fishing rod, etc. A piece of floating material, such as foam, can be disposed at an intermediate portion of the tube and defines the amount of material or portion of the tube that extends out of the water.
