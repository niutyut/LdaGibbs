title: Apparatus, game and method for capturing articles with coil spring

abstract: 
A coil spring toy with the ball-trapping tool attached to one or more ends is disclosed. The coil spring toy may be used with a game apparatus having a toy stairway, and a set of lightweight balls of a specific size. A method to play the game includes mechanically starting the spring toy to move downstairs due to gravity and its known properties. If started properly, a spring toy will capture the balls, located on the stairs, with the trapping tool, while it lands on each stair. Captured balls may be kept inside spring toy while it moves and finally stops. The balls may be transparent and may be filled with particles to produce additional visual and sound effects. Collected balls can be manually released out of spring toy by means of its stretching. After balls are released and counted, and are placed back on the stairs, the action may be repeated. The goal of the game is to start a spring toy so that it will collect the maximal number of balls on the stairs during one or several actions in order to get the maximal number of points of designated values.
