title: Polishing apparatus

abstract: 
A polishing apparatus has a polishing table () with a polishing surface () attached thereon, and a top ring () for pressing a workpiece (W) against the polishing surface (). The top ring () has a housing () and a retainer ring () vertically movable in the housing () for holding an outer circumferential edge of the workpiece (W). The polishing apparatus includes a vertically moving mechanism operable to vertically move the top ring (), a bracket () vertically movable together with the top ring (), a stopper () adjustable in vertical position to prevent downward movement of the bracket (), and a sensor () for detecting a distance between the stopper () and the bracket (). The polishing apparatus also includes a control unit () operable to adjust the stopper () in vertical position when the retainer ring () is brought into contact with the polishing surface () while a lower surface of the housing () of the top ring () is located, at a predetermined height from the polishing surface () so that the distance between the stopper () and the bracket () is equal to a difference between a height of the lower surface of the housing () from the polishing surface () at the time of polishing and the predetermined height.
