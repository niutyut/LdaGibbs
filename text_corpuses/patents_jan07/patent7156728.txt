title: Adjustable support for a sander

abstract: 
An adjustable moveable support for an existing drywall sander. A plurality of legs are centrally mounted and extend from a collar to rotating caster wheels which rest on a floor. The caster wheels allow for movement of the moveable support. Extending through the collar is a vertical boom with a mounting sleeve at one end of the vertical boom. An existing pole-like drywall sander may be mounted in the mounting sleeve. The height of the vertical boom may be adjusted to place the existing drywall sander in proximity to a drywall surface to be sanded. Control handles mounted on the legs allow an operator to engage the sander on the drywall sander on the drywall surface to be sanded. The caster wheels allow the device to be readily moved to appropriately sand seams or other surfaces in the drywall. A control handle may be mounted on either side of the adjustable support so that it may be used with equal ease by left-handed or right-handed users. The legs fold so the removable support may be folded for easy transportation or storage.
