title: Resolution of chiral compounds using aminocyclopentadienyl ruthenium catalysts

abstract: 
A chiral compound, particularly a chiral secondary alcohol, can be efficiently resolved under a mild condition by acylation with an alkenyl acetate in the presence of a novel aminocyclopentadienyl ruthenium complex, an enzyme catalyst, and a base.
