title: Apparatus and method for conveying a bowling pin in a pinsetter pin sock in a bowing alley

abstract: 
The present invention provides for an apparatus and method for conveying a bowling pin into a Pin Sock at a bowling alley. This invention stitches a Hardened Inserting into a Pin Sock. The lip of the Hardened Insert extends beyond the end of output exit of the Pin Sock. Moreover, the output exit of the Pin Sock is larger than traditional Pin Socks. The insertion of a Hardening Insert makes the Pin Sock, and in particular the lower end of the Pin Sock more durable against the constant wear and tear caused by bowling pins entering the sock from an Overflow Chute. By reducing this wear and tear, the bowling pins exiting the Pin Sock would cause less damage to the Transport Band where the pins are deposited after exiting the Pin Sock. Additionally, the enlarged output exit reduces the possibility of pin jams as compared to traditional Pin Socks.
