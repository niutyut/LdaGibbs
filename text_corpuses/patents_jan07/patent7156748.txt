title: Golf training device and method

abstract: 
The golf training device comprises an arm band for attachment on the lead arm, above the elbow, and a resilient cord securable at one end to the arm band and having means at the other end for selectively attaching the cord on a golf club below the grip. A general method aspect of the invention comprises attaching an arm band to the golfer's leading arm above the elbow, connecting a resilient cord from the arm band to an attachment means on the club below the grip, assuming a stance by holding the grip of the club with both hands so that the club shaft extends in front and between legs of the golfer, and extending the hands to stretch the cord between the arm band and the shaft until the club head is in a desired position. The golfer maintains the stretch in the cord while moving the club back and forth in either a short or full swing. The training aid has several adjustable features that enable personalization as to fitting the body size and type of each golfer, and repositioning from use to use as the golfer's swing improves.
