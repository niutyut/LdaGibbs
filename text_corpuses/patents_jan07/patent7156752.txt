title: Gyroscopic golf club heads

abstract: 
This invention creates a new and truly scientifically advanced design and structuring of golf club heads based on Sir Isaac Newton's First Law of Motion. A very precise and controlled path of inertial swing is then developed by this gyroscopic club head. This is accomplished by utilizing a spherical metal weight positioned rearward of the striking surface. Further, a weight is positioned at the club head's center of gravity. Further again, a metal spherical weight is positioned at the club head's center of gravity. All this creates and results in a smooth, easy and natural flowing swing which is in one arc line and in one plane. The concept presented herein, enables the manufacture of unlimited variety of golf clubs.
