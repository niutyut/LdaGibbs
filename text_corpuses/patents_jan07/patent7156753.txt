title: Golf putter head

abstract: 
A golf putter head is disclosed wherein the putter head has a sole that defines an arcuate surface in two directions?from the toe to the heel and from the tail or rear end of the putter head to the putter face. As a result, the position of the putter head, hosel and shaft may be moved by the golfer without adversely affecting the performance of the putter. Further, the arcuate surface of the sole from the tail to the putter face reduces drag or friction in the event the putter head strikes the ground before striking the ball. The arcuate surface of the sole also provides for improved face balance of the putter head.
