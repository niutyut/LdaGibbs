title: Durable golf tee

abstract: 
An improved durable golf tee comprises a separate upper portion and a separate lower portion that are axially aligned and enclosed within a flexible collar. The upper portion has an upper end for supporting a golf ball, an upper shank and a lower end having an upper annular flange. The lower portion has a pointed lower end for inserting the tee into the ground, a lower shank and an upper end having a lower annular flange. The flexible collar encloses the lower end of the upper portion and the upper end of the lower portion, forming an integral golf tee, whereby the upper portion and the lower portion are independently flexible within the collar.
In a second embodiment, the interior tee portions are molded as a single tee component having the upper portion and the lower portion interconnected by a reduced-diameter (break-away) center portion. The center portion and the respective inner ends of the upper and lower portions are enclosed within the flexible collar. Once the break-away center portion is fractured, the upper portion and the lower portion are independently flexible within the flexible collar.
The durable golf tee is formed by a method including the steps of: molding the upper portion and lower portion of a strong, tough plastic (nylon) material; and over-molding the upper shank, upper flange, lower shank, and lower flange with a flexible (rubber) collar.
