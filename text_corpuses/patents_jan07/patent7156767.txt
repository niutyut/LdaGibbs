title: Multiple gear stage automatic transmission

abstract: 
A multiple stage transmission in planetary design comprises three planetary gear sets (P, P, P), at least six rotatable shafts (), the same as at least six shifting elements (), the drive shaft () is permanently connectable with the spider of the first planetary gear set (P) and via one clutch () with the shaft () which is connected with the sun gear of the second planetary gear set (P) and the sun gear of the third planetary gear set (P) and connectable, via the clutch (), with the shaft (), the shaft () being connected on one side with the ring gear of the first planetary gear set (P) and one the other side loosely connectable, via one clutch (), with the shaft () which is permanently connected with the spider of the second planetary gear set (P) and via one brake () attachable to the housing (G). Besides, the driven shaft () is connected with the spider of the third planetary gear set (P) and the ring gear of the second planetary gear set (P), the shaft () being permanently connected with the ring gear of the third planetary gear set (P), via one clutch (), loosely connectable with the shaft () and via one brake () attachable to the housing (G) and the sun gear of the first planetary gear set (P) being non-rotatably connected via one shaft () with the housing (G).
