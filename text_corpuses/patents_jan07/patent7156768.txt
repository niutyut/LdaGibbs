title: Multi-stage transmission

abstract: 
The multi-stage transmission comprises a drive input shaft and a drive output shaft, three single-web planetary gearset assemblies (P, P, P), at least six rotating shafts () and at least five shift elements () so that six forward gears and one reverse gear can be engaged, such that the drive input shaft () is connected to the solar gearwheel of the first planetary gearset (P), the annular gearwheel of the first planetary gearset (P) is in rotationally fixed connection with the housing, the drive output shaft () is connected to the annular gearwheel of the second planetary gearset (P) and to the web of the third planetary gearset (P), and the shaft () is permanently connected to the web of the second planetary gearset (P) and to the annular gearwheel of the third planetary gearset (P). The shaft () is permanently connected to the solar gearwheel of the second planetary gearset (P), the shaft () is permanently connected to the web of the first planetary gearset (P), and the shaft () is permanently connected to the solar gearwheel of the third planetary gearset (P). The planetary gearset assemblies (P, P, P) are coupled by means of shafts () and shift elements ().
