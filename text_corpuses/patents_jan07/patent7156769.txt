title: Annular member and drive device comprising the annular member

abstract: 
An annular member intended to form a part of a bearing unit includes a first portion which radially externally forms a race for receiving at least one row of balls and radially internally is provided with teeth and forms a gear rim. The first portion is provided with a through-hole in the radial direction through the gear rim, which hole has a sufficiently great cross section to allow introduction of the balls radially from inside into the race.
