title: Easy access stepper

abstract: 
An apparatus is disclosed for an easy to mount and easy to use exercise machine especially helpful to disabled, convalescing and elderly people. Both foot pedals () are at their lowest position to start and are dependent on each other. The lever-arms () have a long turning radius that minimizes the angle-change of the pedals. The apparatus () has a protective cover (), two foot pedals (), two lever arms (), an energy dissipation means () with a neutral positioning means for the pedals, a variable exertion-force adjustment means (), a pedal dependency mechanism (), a transmission (), an exertion monitoring device (), handle bars (), a frame (), and is easily modified to include an elevator mechanism () that raises and lowers the pedals. The unique design keeps most of the moving parts in constant tension eliminating both noise and wear due to direction changes and the need for tight tolerances. The unique design also keeps most of the forces in a straight line eliminating wear and the need for heavy high strength parts.
