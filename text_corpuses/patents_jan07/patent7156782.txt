title: Methods and apparatus for supporting selectorized dumbbells

abstract: 
Various exercise systems include a frame; first and second selectorized dumbbell assemblies; and first and second weight supports mounted on the frame and configured to support respective dumbbell assemblies. On certain embodiments, the weight supports are movably mounted on the frame to facilitate more than one type of activity and/or to accommodate more than mode of exercise. Also, some embodiments include a body support that is movable between a first position which is suitable for exercise and a second position which is suitable for transportation and/or storage. In several such instances, the body support is a bench that is movable relative to the weight supports, between a generally horizontal orientation and a generally vertical orientation.
