title: Device for exercising one's thighs and buttocks

abstract: 
An exercising device upon which one kneels and can exercise one's thighs and buttocks by pushing one's knees away from each other in a direction substantially parallel with a line through one's hip joints has a pair of longitudinal swing arms that are pivotally mounted at first ends thereof to a respective, upwardly extending, spaced apart pivot axes. The swing arms extend generally laterally outwardly from the respective pivot axes and can pivot about the respective pivot axes from a first position in which the swing arms are substantially parallel with each other to a second position in which distal ends of the swing arms diverge outwardly from each other so that the swing arms form an acute angle with each other. Supports are provided on the swing arms for accommodating knees of a user of the machine in a position adjacent respective distal ends of the swing arms, with the shins of the user lying adjacent respective swing arms so that the user can kneel on the supports and can move his or her knees in reciprocating motion away from and back toward each other in a direction such that a line through the knees of the user is substantially parallel with a line through the hip joints of the user.
