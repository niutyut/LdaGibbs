title: Exercise machine and method for exercising the anterior deltoid muscle group

abstract: 
An exercise machine and an associated method of exercising that isolates and exercises the anterior deltoid muscles. The exercise machine provides articulating arm elements that support contact surfaces near the biceps of a person who is exercising. To perform the exercise, a person places his/her biceps against the contact surfaces of the articulating arm elements and attempts to elevate their arms forward about their shoulders. The contact surfaces press against the bicep regions of the person's arms and resist the movement. Since the resistance force is applied directly to the upper arm, the exercise does not involve any muscles in the hand, wrist or lower arm. Nearly all of the action needed to perform the exercise is dedicated to the anterior deltoid muscle group. Thus, the anterior deltoid muscle group is isolated for the exercise routine.
