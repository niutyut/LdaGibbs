In the preferred embodiment, the contoured, shaped piece of material is ergonomically designed and has the approximate shape of a portion of a hyperbolic paraboloid with a surface that is convex in one direction and concave in the perpendicular direction, thereby optimizing comfort, support, and contact with a person's foot or hand.
