title: Hernia prosthesis

abstract: 
A prosthesis for repairing a tissue or muscle wall defect. The prosthesis comprises a layer of repair fabric having first and second and an edge that extends between the first and second surfaces. The prosthesis also includes a barrier that is inhibits the formation of adhesions with adjacent tissues and organs. The barrier may overlap a portion of the first and second surfaces. The barrier may be formed separate from and attached to the layer of repair fabric to permanently cover a portion of the edge. The repair fabric may be formed from a material which is susceptible to the formation of adhesions with sensitive tissue and organs. The cord protector may be formed from material which inhibits the formation of adhesions with sensitive tissue and organs. The barrier may overlie a portion of at least one of the first and second surfaces of the repair fabric.
