title: Wireless LAN architecture for integrated time-critical and non-time-critical services within medical facilities

abstract: 
A wireless local area network (WLAN) system comprises multiple access points that are distributed throughout a medical facility to provide wireless access to a hardwired network. The access points implement multiple WLAN protocols, including a realtime protocol for realtime patient monitoring (telemetry) and a standard WLAN protocol (such as IEEE 802.11 within an ISM band) for providing general-purpose wireless access. Some or all of the access points preferably implement both WLAN protocols such that the different WLANs and wireless device types share network access resources. Some or all of the access points may also include RF location-tracking modules which may be used to track locations of patients, hospital personnel, capital equipment, and/or disposable medical supplies. Also disclosed are an antenna design which may be used with the access points to improve reception (particularly for patient monitoring), and a TDMA timeslot rotation method for avoiding lockstep interference between access points that operate on the same channel.
