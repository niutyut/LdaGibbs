title: Method and apparatus for health and disease management combining patient data monitoring with wireless internet connectivity

abstract: 
Embodiments of the invention provide a method and apparatus for a wireless health monitoring system for interactively monitoring a disease or health condition of a patient by connecting an internet-enabled wireless web device (?WWD?) to a health monitoring device which may be a medical device or other health related device such as an exercise machine. The WWD may be connected to the health monitoring device directly by a wired connection to a generic input/output port of the WWD using an optional adaptor if necessary. Alternatively, the WWD may be wirelessly connected to the health monitoring device, such as via an infrared or radio frequency connection, including using protocols such as Bluetooth or 802.11. The wireless connection may also employ an adaptor if necessary. The user may also input data to the WWD manually, such as by a keypad, keyboard, stylus, or optionally by voice command.
