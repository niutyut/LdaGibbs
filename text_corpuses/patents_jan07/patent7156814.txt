title: Apparatus and method for harvesting and handling tissue samples for biopsy analysis

abstract: 
A sectional cassette () for use in a process for harvesting and handling tissue samples for biopsy analysis is disclosed. In the procedure, a tissue biopsy sample is placed on a tissue trapping supporting material (A?) that can withstand tissue preparation procedures, and which can be cut with a microtome. The tissue is immobilized on the material, and the material and the tissue are held in the cassette () subjected to a process for replacing tissue fluids with wax. The tissue and supporting material are sliced for mounting on slides using a microtome. Harvesting devices and containers () using the filter material () are disclosed. An automated process is also disclosed.
