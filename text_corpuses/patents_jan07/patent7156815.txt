title: Soft tissue biopsy instrument

abstract: 
Soft tissue biopsy apparatus for obtaining a tissue specimen comprises a compact handle functioning as a housing having an opening at a front end thereof through which a tubular cannula is arranged to pass. Disposed in the lumen of the cannula is a stylet having a notch formed near its distal end in which a tissue sample is to be captured. First and second springs are operatively coupled individually to the cannula and stylet and a cocking slide incorporating a force reducing mechanism is used to compress the springs while establishing the size of the specimen to be collected in the notch. A trigger mounted on the cocking slide can be used to release the compressed springs in close succession to first advance the end of the stylet beyond the end of the cannula whereby tissue to be extracted flows into the notch and then the spring driving the cannula is released forcing the cannula forward and severing the piece of tissue contained in the notch from surrounding tissue.
