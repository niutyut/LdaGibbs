title: Massage ball

abstract: 
A multi-layered massage ball which substantially mirrors the hardness and deformation characteristics of the human thumb and is particularly effective in relieving tender and painful muscle conditions, including but not limited to trigger points. The massage ball typically includes a core, at least one resilient layer encapsulating the core, and a ball cover. The massage ball may be pressed and rolled against the afflicted area or areas to substantially alleviate pain and discomfort associated with muscle or connective tissue conditions.
