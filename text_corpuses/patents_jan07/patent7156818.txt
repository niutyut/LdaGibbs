title: Multi-functional joint brace

abstract: 
A multi-functional brace for a joint includes a releasable locking mechanism that allows the brace to be set for static stretch of the joint in either flexion or extension, and a range of motion assembly that allows for free movement of the joint through its natural axis over a controlled range of motion when the locking mechanism is released.
