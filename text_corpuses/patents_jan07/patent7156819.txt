title: Flexion and extension device

abstract: 
An orthotic device may be utilized to promote flexion or extension of a patient's wrist. At least one support member having a pivotal portion may be angularly positioned through the use of a tensioning member in conjunction with a hinge to effect the desired therapeutic fixation of the joint, or alternatively, to permit a limited range of motion. The tensioning member is connected on one end to a post, and on the other end to an anchor, wherein the positions of flexion or extension are created depending on the direction in which the tensioning member extends from the anchor to the post.
