title: Extremity support rack

abstract: 
A portable extremity support rack that offers a quick, easy, accessible and effective way to apply the standard RICE principle for post traumatic injury management. The extremity support rack collapses into a portable carrying case so it can be easily stored when not in use or quickly transported to different settings where injury management may take place. An upper surface and a lower surface in the extremity support rack are adjustably elevated and positioned to comfortably fit injured limbs of any shape and size.
