title: Safety adapter for needle hub assembly

abstract: 
To retrofit a conventional needle hub assembly with a needle protection housing, a sleeve having a collar rotatably fitted thereabout is fitted to the needle hub. The sleeve has a proximal portion and a distal portion. The proximal portion has a diameter that is dimensioned to fit over the needle hub while the distal portion has a diameter that allows the needle cap of the needle hub assembly to be inserted thereinto so as to be frictionally coupled to the needle hub. There are a plurality of flanges or ears extending at the proximal end of the proximal portion. These flanges are configured to overlie the flanges formed at the base of the needle hub used to mate with the luer of a syringe. When the needle hub assembly is threadingly mated to the luer of the syringe, the sleeve, along with the collar mounted thereabout and to which the needle protection housing is attached, is also mated to the luer. As a consequence, a conventional needle hub assembly could be retrofitted with the inventive sleeve assembly without causing any dead space which may unnecessarily waste to be dispensed medicament and/or collected patient fluid.
