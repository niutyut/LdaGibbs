abstract: 
An embodiment of the present invention provides means for extending a chafing barrier through a leg opening down the upper inner thigh of the wearer of an absorbent device. The chafing barrier comprises a layer of soft padded material, such as foam plastic, wadding, elastic gel, or a similar material. In one embodiment of the present invention, the chafing barrier is attached to a disposable pad. In another embodiment of the present invention, the chafing barrier is attached to the inside of an undergarment that surrounds or is integrated with an absorbent device. In still another embodiment of the present invention, the chafing barrier further comprises a top surface of absorbent material having a dermatological agent disposed thereon. Optionally, the dermatological agent comprises a moisturizing lotion, a drying agent, an antibiotic, a fungicide, or a topical steroid to aid in healing and/or soothing chafed skin. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, other topical materials may be incorporated on or in the chafing barrier to promote comfort and/or healing.
