title: Disposable pull-on undergarment

abstract: 
A disposable pull-on undergarment includes a pair of leg-openings provided with elastic members. Each of the elastic members extends along a peripheral edge of the leg-openings and is spaced outward from each of transversely opposite side edges of the core by a distance which is larger in any one of the front and rear waist regions than the other of them as measured in a substantially middle zone of a crotch region. Along a folding line Y extending in the transverse direction to divide the undergarment in upper and lower halves, the undergarment is folded toward any one of the front and rear waist regions in which the distance is relatively large.
