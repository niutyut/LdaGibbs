title: Absorbent Article having a stiffening element and elongate through-hole

abstract: 
Absorbent article, such as a sanitary towel, with a stiffening element which is intended to contribute to the three-dimensional shape of the article during its use. The stiffening element is in a plane state before use of the article. The stiffening element has in the rear portion an elongate through-hole which extends in the longitudinal direction of the article and along the centre line of the article, as a result of which the article is during use provided, by virtue of lateral forces arising in the rear portion of the article, with a fold along the longitudinal direction of the article along the hole. The fold extends into the cleft between the buttocks of the wearer during use of the article and in this way stabilizes the article in position on the wearer.
