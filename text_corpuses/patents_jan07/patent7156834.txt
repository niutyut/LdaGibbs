title: Disposable body fluid absorbent pad

abstract: 
A disposable body fluid absorbent pad comprises a liquid-pervious topsheet, a liquid-impervious backsheet, a liquid-absorbent core interposed between these sheets and a strap adapted to pull the pad in a longitudinal direction. The strap comprises first and second straps attached to transversely opposite side edge margins of the pad, respectively, so to extend outward from an end margin of a front region. These first and second straps have inner fixed portions fixed to the topsheet, outer fixed portions fixed to the backsheet and hand-grips extending between the inner fixed portions and the outer fixed portions, respectively.
