title: Arrangement and a method for interacting with an internal body organ

abstract: 
Example embodiments of the present invention relate to an arrangement and a method for interacting with an internal body organ. The arrangement may include a sheath in which at least two elongate structural elements are inserted. The structural elements may each have a proximal end and a distal end. The sheath may have a proximal end and a distal end, said distal end being open. When the structural elements are displaced relative to the sheath, they may extend through the open distal end of the sheath and at least partly in the transverse direction away from the sheath for distending and/or expanding interaction between the distal end of each structural element and a body organ.
