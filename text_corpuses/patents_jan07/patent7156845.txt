title: Method and apparatus for creating a bi-polar virtual electrode used for the ablation of tissue

abstract: 
A method and apparatus for creating a virtual electrode to ablate bodily tissue. The apparatus includes an outer tube, a first electrode, an inner tube and a second electrode. The outer tube is fluidly connected to a source of conductive fluid and defines a proximal end and a distal end. The distal end includes an opening for delivering conductive fluid from the outer tube. The first electrode is disposed at the distal end of the outer tube for applying a current to conductive fluid delivered from the outer tube. The inner tube is coaxially received within the outer tube and is connected to a source of conductive fluid. The inner tube defines a proximal end and a distal end, with the distal end forming an opening for delivering conductive fluid from the inner tube. Finally, the second electrode is disposed at the distal end of the inner tube for applying a current to conductive fluid delivered from the inner tube. With this configuration, upon final assembly, the distal end of the outer tube is axially spaced from the distal end of the inner tube such that the first electrode is spaced from the second electrode. As a result, a bi-polar virtual electrode can be established.
