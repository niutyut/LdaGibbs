title: Vessel sealer and divider for use with small trocars and cannulas

abstract: 
An endoscopic bipolar forceps includes a housing and a shaft affixed to the housing. The shaft includes a longitudinal axis defined therethrough and a pair of jaw members attached to a distal end thereof. The forceps also includes a drive assembly for moving one of the jaw members relative to the other jaw member from a first position wherein the movable jaw members are disposed in spaced relation relative to each other to a second position wherein the jaw members are closer one another for manipulating tissue. A movable handle is included which is rotatable about a pivot to force a drive flange of the movable handle into mechanical cooperation with the drive assembly to move the jaw members from the open and closed positions. The pivot is located a fixed distance from the longitudinal axis and the drive flange is located generally along the longitudinal axis. The forceps is connected to a source of electrosurgical energy connected to each jaw member such that the jaw members are capable of conducting bipolar energy through tissue held therebetween to effect a tissue seal.
