title: Apparatus for the correction of chest wall deformities such as Pectus Carinatum and method of using the same

abstract: 
An apparatus for the correction of wall chest deformities, such as ?Pectus Carinatum?, comprising: a bar () having a flattened cross-section, having a minimum bending strength according to the values defined by ASTM F382-95, plates () having a slot () in the medium portion so as to fit the corresponding end of the bar () and peripheral holes () for securing the bone parts. The bar ends comprise planar grooves () determining the wall thickness substantially similar to the height of the slot () of the plate (). The wall of the grooves () has aligned holes () in order to form with the respective plate () and by using screws (), a fixed removable attachment that allows the axial registration of the bar (). Method for the correction of Pectus Carinatum using said apparatus in order to achieve a normal anatomic shape of the chest wall.
