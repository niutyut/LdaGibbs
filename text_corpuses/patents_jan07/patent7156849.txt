title: Rod reduction nut and driver tool

abstract: 
A rod reduction device is provided having a reduction nut adapted to mate to the rod-receiving portion of a spinal implant, and a driver tool that is effective to engage the reduction nut such that rotation of the driver tool rotates the reduction nut to reduce a rod positioned between the reduction nut and within the rod-receiving head of a spinal implant into the rod-seating portion of the head of the spinal implant. The driver tool can include a support  formed on a distal end thereof that is adapted to be disposed within the rod-receiving head of a spinal implant to prevent the rod-receiving head of the implant from collapsing during use of the rod reduction device.
