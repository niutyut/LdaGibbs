title: Measuring apparatus for total knee replacement operation

abstract: 
An apparatus in a total knee replacement and arthroplasty operation for measuring a joint gap and ligament balance between a osteotomized surface at a femoral distal end and a osteotomized surface at a tibial proximal end. The apparatus is provided with a base  from which an engaging plate  extends by way of an arm, so that the engaging plate  contacts with the osteotomized surface at the tibial proximal end. A moving body  is vertically movably connected to the base  from which moving body  an arm  extends, to which arm a supporting plate  is rotatably mounted about a central axis. The supporting plate  has, at its top surface, a projected portion  to which an auxiliary guiding piece  is connected under a snap like fitted manner. A femoral component  is mounted, at its groove portion  to the osteotomized surface at the femoral distal end. The engaging plate  as well as the supporting plate  are under an offset arrangement with respect to the base and moving body, respectively.
