title: Lens delivery system

abstract: 
A lens delivery system having a plunger, an injector body and a nozzle portion connected to the injector body, the nozzle portion having a hinged lid and a hollow body with a lens holding platform formed beneath the hinged lid. The cartridge has an elongated nozzle tube or tip with a bore, the bore communicating with the lens holding platform. The bottom of the bore is rounded, which causes the edges of the lens between the lens haptics to fold upwardly as the lens is pushed down the bore from the platform by the plunger. A removable pin fits into the lid and prevents the lens from moving down the bore of the tip during shipment and storage.
