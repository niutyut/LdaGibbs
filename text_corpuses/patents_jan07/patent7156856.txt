title: Method and apparatus for follicular extraction and transplantation

abstract: 
Apparatus and method are for extraction of follicular units. A dermal biopsy punch is utilized in combination with a suction device for extraction purposes. The use of suction to extract the follicular unit allows for distribution of the forces over a large area of the unit, helping to keep the unit intact. A perforating device, affixed to the punch, is utilized to weaken the structural integrity of the extraction area. The perforating device, having a single spike member which is inserted into the skin at a small, previously determined depth, in several locations, surrounding the follicular unit and reducing the holding tissue around the unit. The spike member of the perforating device is relatively thin and unlikely to damage the follicular unit. Because suction is utilized to extract the follicular unit, the distal end of the apparatus may have a guard which functions to prevent the extracted follicular units from being vacuumed further therein.
