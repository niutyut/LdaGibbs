title: Implant

abstract: 
An implant () has an areal basic structure made from weft-knitted or warp-knitted fabric which has a greater extendability in a central area () than in the peripheral area () of the implant (). The basic structure can be deformed in the central area () of the implant () to produce a projection () into the third dimension. The implant () preferably has a stiffening structure () in the area of the free end () of the projection (). The implant () is particularly suitable for treating hernias.
