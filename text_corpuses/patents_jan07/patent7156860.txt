title: Balloon catheter

abstract: 
The invention relates to balloon catheters () and methods of treatment for exerting internal pressure on surrounding tissue of a mammalian duct or cavity in a section thereof having a substantially circular cylindrical configuration. The elongate rigid distal section and the intermediate section of the catheter contain a central tube (), whose distal part is provided with at least one outlet () for medium within the balloon, and whose intermediate part is surrounded by an axially displaceable tube (), onto whose distal end the proximal end of the balloon is attached. The balloon has an envelope which is constituted by at least one substantially gas- and liquid-impermeable and elastic internal layer and an external layer of limited radial expansion, said expansion being substantially independent of the axial length of said balloon. The balloon may he encompassed by a radially expandible stent (), or can be equipped with means for supplementing treatment using pressure with heat treatment.
