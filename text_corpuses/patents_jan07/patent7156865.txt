title: Irradiation apparatus and system, especially for photodynamic therapy

abstract: 
To allow optimum adaptation of irradiation equipment, especially irradiation equipment for photodynamic therapy, to the individual anatomy of a patient, an irradiation head () is provided with a plate-shaped middle section () and plate-shaped lateral leaves (), mounted on the middle section () in such a way that they can swivel. The irradiation head can be rotated about two perpendicular axes (U, W), and its height can be adjusted. With its lateral leaves () extended, the irradiation head () has a plane configuration formed by the middle section () and the extended lateral leaves (). The configuration is suitable for areal irradiation of the trunk or extremities of a patient. It can also be configured to a rectangular U shape suitable for three-sided irradiation, when the lateral leaves () are swivelled 90?. Radiation sources, e.g., cylindrical or compact light fixtures, which have a spectrum from UV, through visible light, to IR and are preferably interchangeable, are provided in or on the undersides of the middle section () and the lateral leaves (). The middle section () is mounted at one end of a preferably telescoping swivel arm () by means of a first swivel joint (). A second swivel joint () is provided for mounting the other end of the swivel arm () on the upper end of a column (), which is supported in a column support () in such a way that it can be moved along its longitudinal axis (Z) and rotated about its longitudinal axis (Z). The column support () is mounted, for example, on a control console ().
