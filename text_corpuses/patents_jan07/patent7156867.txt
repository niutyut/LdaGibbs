title: Uniform selective cerebral hypothermia

abstract: 
Disclosed is an apparatus and method for uniform selective cerebral hypothermia. The apparatus includes a brain-cooling probe, a head-cooling cap, a body-heating device and a control console. The brain-cooling probe cools the cerebrospinal fluid within one or more brain ventricles. The brain-cooling probe withdraws a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid from a ventricle into a cooling chamber located ex-vivo in close proximity to the head. After the cerebrospinal fluid is cooled it is then reintroduced back into the ventricle. This process is repeated in a cyclical or continuous manner. The head-cooling cap cools the cranium and therefore cools surface of the brain. The combination of ventricle cooling and cranium cooling provides for whole brain cooling while minimizing temperature gradients within the brain. The body-heating device replaces heat removed from the body by the brain-cooling probe and the head-cooling cap and provides for a temperature difference between the brain and the body where the brain is maintained a temperature lower than the temperature of the body.
