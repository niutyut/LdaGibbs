title: Arcuate artificial hemi-lumbar interbody spinal fusion implant having an asymmetrical leading end

abstract: 
An artificial interbody spinal implant adapted for placement across an intervertebral space formed across the height of a disc space between two adjacent vertebral bodies is disclosed. The implant has an asymmetrical leading end adapted to sit upon the more peripheral areas, such as the apophyseal rim and the apophyseal rim area, of the vertebral end plate region of the vertebral bodies without protruding therefrom. The asymmetrical leading end allows for the safe use of an implant of maximum length for the implantation space into which it is installed. The implant can also include an asymmetric trailing end adapted to sit upon the more peripheral areas of the vertebral end plate region of the vertebral bodies.
