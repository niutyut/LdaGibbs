title: Biodegradable/bioactive nucleus pulposus implant and method for treating degenerated intervertebral discs

abstract: 
A bioactive/biodegradable nucleus implant for repairing degenerated intervertebral discs that is inflated inside the nucleus space after the degenerated nucleus has been removed to re-pressurize the nuclear space within the intervertebral disc. The implant is inflated with a high molecular weight fluid, gel or combination of fluid and elastomer, preferably an under-hydrated HA hydrogel/growth factor mixture with or without host cells. The implant includes an internal, integral, self-sealing valve that allows one-way filling of the implant after it is placed within the disc, and is made from a material that allows fibrous in growth thereby stabilizing the implant. A variety of substances can be incorporated into the implant to promote healing, prevent infection, or arrest pain.
