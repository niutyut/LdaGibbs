title: Femur fixture and set of femur fixtures

abstract: 
A femur fixture for a hip-joint prosthesis comprising an intraosseous anchoring structure of a generally circular cross-section for screwing laterally into a complementary bore drilled laterally into the neck of a femur after resection of the femur head to an anchored position. The intraosseous anchoring structure has a proximal end, a distal end, a relatively short frusto-conical proximal section at the proximal end, and a proximal cylindrical section having a screw thread profile thereon. The proximal cylindrical section extends from the frusto-conical proximal section towards the distal end of the anchoring structure. The frusto-conical proximal section and the proximal cylindrical section each being dimensioned so as to bear against the cortex of the femur neck when the intraosseous anchoring structure is in the anchored position. The invention also relates to a set of such femur fixtures, wherein the frusto-conical proximal section and the proximal cylindrical section of each fixture in the set have different dimensions, whereby the fixture in the set having the frusto-conical proximal section and the proximal cylindrical section of correct size for abutting the cortex of the femur neck of a particular patient can be selected for use in that patient.
