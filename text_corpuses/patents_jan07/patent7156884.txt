title: Compositions and methods for dyeing keratinous fibers

abstract: 
Pro-dyes of direct dyes having an enzymatically-labile functionality, e.g. glutaramide derivatives of direct dyes of formula (I) or their physiologically acceptable salts,


are described, as well as compositions for dyeing keratinous fibers containing these pro-dyes, as well as compositions for dyeing keratinous fibers containing a combination of at least one pro-dye and at least one enzyme capable of cleaving the glutaramide functionality in the pro-dye. A method for dyeing keratinous fibers with the aforementioned dyeing compositions is also described.
