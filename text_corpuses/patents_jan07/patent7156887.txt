title: Methods, apparatus, and systems for producing hydrogen from a fuel

abstract: 
Methods and apparatus for producing hydrogen are provided. The methods and apparatus utilize reforming catalysts in order to produce hydrogen gas. The reforming catalysts may be platinum group metals on a support material, and they may be located in a reforming reaction zone of a primary reactor. The support material may an oxidic support having a ceria zirconia promoter. The support material may be an oxidic support and a neodymium stabilizer. The support material may also be an oxidic support material and at least one Group IA, Group IIA, manganese, or iron metal promoter. The primary reactor may have a first and second reforming reaction zones. Upstream reforming catalysts located in the first reforming reaction zone may be selected to perform optimally under the conditions in the first reforming reaction zone. Downstream reforming catalysts located in the second reforming reaction zone may be selected to perform optimally under the conditions in the second reforming reaction zone.
