title: Cerium-based abrasive material and method for preparation thereof

abstract: 
The object of the present invention is to provide a powder cerium-based abrasive which enables the preparation of a cerium-based abrasive slurry, in which the dispersed state of the abrasive particles is maintained for a long period of time, simply by blending it with a dispersion medium such as water and which makes easier the after-treatment of the abrasive slurry having been used. The cerium-based abrasive of this invention is a cerium-based abrasive including chlorine-containing compounds in which chlorine (element) is contained in amounts, in terms of total mass, equivalent to 0.05% to 5.0% of the mass of the total rare earth oxide contained therein. An abrasive slurry including the abrasive of this invention as a solid content is superior in dispersion maintaining properties of its abrasive particles. Accordingly, an abrasive slurry having a stable concentration of the solid content can be supplied continuously. Further, the abrasive requires no dispersant for maintaining its dispersed state, and hence separation treatment for a dispersant is unnecessary after the abrasive has been used. Thus, the abrasive according to the present invention makes simpler the after-treatment of the abrasive slurry after use.
