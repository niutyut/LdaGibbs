title: Anti-infection and toxin elimination device

abstract: 
The invention provides an apparatus for removing airborne pathogens and toxic substances from a surface of an article or a volume of air, comprising: a main processing chamber having a door for ingress to and egress from the main processing chamber, at least two high voltage electrodes for generating a current. The electrode can form ozone, if desired, to destroy pathogens. Optionally, the electrodes can be in a sealed or unsealed glass tube, with or without mercury, to generate ultraviolet light for photochemical reaction with pathogens or other contaminants. The apparatus also includes a post processing chamber comprising at least one filter for removing or absorbing airborne particulates and pathogens, and includes low voltage electrodes to neutralize charges in air transmitted from the main processing chamber. The system further includes a shutter between the main processing chamber and the post processing chamber for preventing ultraviolet light from entering the post processing chamber from the main processing chamber; and a fan for moving fluid from the main processing chamber to the post processing chamber.
