title: Area wide municipal electronic air cleaner and method

abstract: 
The present invention provides a power generation facility that is adapted to clean large air masses. Air from the environment, which normally contains the most pollutants, is directed into an air flow path through which large quantities of air are directed by a plurality of large diameter fans. The large air flow is directed through electrically insulated cooling fins which cool heated gas from power generators. The electrically insulated cooling fans have a voltage applied thereto and act as electrodes used to produce an electric field that attracts particles such as pollutants. In a preferred embodiment, a charging section is utilized within the air flow prior to the electrically insulated cooling fins to charge the particles with a charge opposite to the voltage applied to the cooling fins to thereby attract the particles to the cooling fins. A cooling fin washing system with pressurized jets is provided in one embodiment to wash the pollutants from the surface of the cooling fins.
