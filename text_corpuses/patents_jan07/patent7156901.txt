title: Apparatus for simultaneous cleaning of a liquid and a gas

abstract: 
An apparatus for simultaneous cleaning of a liquid and a gas includes a centrifugal rotor delimiting in a casing a separation chamber that is arranged for through flow and cleaning of the liquid. On the outside of the casing separation discs are mounted for rotation with the centrifugal rotor. Between the separation discs there are formed axially extending separation passages formed for through flow and cleaning of the gas.
