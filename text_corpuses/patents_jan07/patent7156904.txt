title: Bonding layer forming solution, method of producing copper-to-resin bonding layer using the solution, and layered product obtained thereby

abstract: 
An aqueous copper-to-resin bonding layer solution comprising: (a) at least one acid type; (b) tin salt or tin oxide; (c) salt or oxide of at least one type of metal selected from the group consisting of: silver, zinc, aluminum, titanium, bismuth, chromium, iron, cobalt, nickel, palladium, gold, and platinum; (d) a reaction accelerator; and (e) a diffusive retaining solvent, so that an alloy layer of tin and the at least one type of metal selected in (c) is formed on the surface of the copper. Subsequently, a portion of the alloy layer is removed, so that a bonding layer containing an alloy of diffused copper, tin, and the at least one type of metal selected in (c) is formed on a surface of copper which enhances the adhesion between copper and resin. The present invention provides the solution, a method of producing the bonding layer, and a product obtained thereby.
