title: Pigment paste for concrete and method for making the same

abstract: 
A pigment paste and a method for making the same that alters the appearance of concrete such that, after the concrete sets, it resembles natural stone concrete sets, it resembles natural stone (e.g., marble, granite, sandstone, bluestone, etc.) without separately applying a finish of any kind to the concrete are provided. The pigment paste preferably comprises a filler, a pigment, an anti-foaming agent, a surfactant, and water. In some embodiments, the surfactant is a water reducing admixture. A concrete compound having a finish resembling natural stone is made by combining the pigment paste with a concrete mix, which includes a cementitious material with aggregate and water, and a chemical admixture. Upon adding the pigment paste and mixing it, the cementitious material is allowed to set, where, after it sets, the concrete has a finish resembling natural stone.
