title: Method and apparatus for chemical vapor deposition capable of preventing contamination and enhancing film growth rate

abstract: 
Disclosed relates to a method for CVD comprises steps of injecting a purge gas, which doesn't either dissolve or generate byproducts by itself, into a reaction chamber where substrates are located; and supplying a source material of vapor phase participating directly in forming a film on the substrates to an inside of the reaction chamber, thus forming a protective curtain in the inside of the reaction chamber by a mutual diffusion-suppressing action between the purge gas and source material. Besides, the invention provides an apparatus for CVD including a susceptor located in a reaction chamber producing a vacuum, on which substrates are placed and a film deposition process is made, the apparatus comprising: a reactive gas confining means, established over the susceptor, having at least a source material supply port through which a source material is supplied and a plurality of openings perforated on a surface thereof; a purge gas supply port through which a purge gas is fed into an outside of the reactive gas confining means; and an exhaust port for discharging exhaust gasses generated in the reaction chamber.
