title: Method of removing scale and inhibiting oxidation in processed sheet metal

abstract: 
A method of removing iron oxide scale from processed sheet metal comprises the steps of: providing a surface conditioning apparatus; and conditioning a surface of the processed sheet metal with the surface conditioning apparatus. In general, the iron oxide scale generally comprises three layers prior to surface conditioning: a wustite layer, a magnetite layer, and a hematite layer. The wustite layer is bonded to a base metal substrate of the processed sheet metal. The magnetite layer is bonded to the wustite layer, and the hematite layer is bonded to the magnetite layer. The surface conditioning apparatus has at least one surface conditioning member. The step of conditioning the surface of the processed sheet metal includes bringing the at least one surface conditioning member into engagement with the surface of the sheet metal. The surface conditioning member is brought into engagement with the surface in a manner to remove substantially all of the hematite and magnetite layers from the surface, and in a manner to remove some but not all of the wustite layer from the surface, so that a portion of the wustite layer remains bonded to the base metal substrate of the processed sheet metal after surface conditioning.
