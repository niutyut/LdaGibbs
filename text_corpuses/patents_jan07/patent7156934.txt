title: Method of manufacturing ceramic honeycomb structural body, and ceramic honeycomb structural body

abstract: 
A method of manufacturing a ceramic honeycomb structure of the present invention, comprising the steps of: stamping sheets onto opposite end faces of a ceramic honeycomb body having a plurality of cells and formed into a honeycomb shape; drilling holes in the sheets at positions corresponding to opening parts of the cells; filling, through the holes, a slurry for sealing into the opening parts of the cells in the opposite end faces of the ceramic honeycomb body; firing the body; and alternately sealing the opening parts of the cells, characterized by comprising the steps of: forming the ceramic honeycomb body into a shape having at least one reference cell different in the shape of the opening part in the end face from the other cells; and drilling the holes in the sheets at the positions corresponding to the opening parts of the reference cell and the other cells with the reference cell taken as a reference point, whereby the ceramic honeycomb structure thus obtained can be manufactured at a low cost, since the cells to be sealed can be easily distinguished, and the holes can be quickly positioned in the drilling step.
