title: Method of manufacturing ceramic laminated body

abstract: 
Unfired first ceramic layers  and at least one unfired second ceramic layer  having a different color from the unfired first ceramic layers  are laminated to prepare an unfired ceramic laminate . Notches  are then formed on a surface of the unfired ceramic laminate  using the second ceramic layer  as a reference. The unfired ceramic laminate  is fired to provide a fired ceramic laminate , which is then divided along the notches  into ceramic composites . In this process, notches having the proper depth can be formed on the unfired ceramic laminate
