title: Apparatus and method for securing engagement between fastening components of pre-fastened garments

abstract: 
In a method and apparatus for securing engagement between fastening components of a pre-fastened garment upon initial assembly thereof, the fastening components are arranged by the apparatus in at least partially opposed relationship with each other and then engaged with each other to define an engagement seam. The garment is then mechanically handled by the apparatus to subject the engagement seam to a shear stress to promote increased engagement between the fastening components during initial assembly of the garment.
