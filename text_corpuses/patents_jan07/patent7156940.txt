title: In-mold indicia printing of plastisol parts

abstract: 
This invention is a method for the precise placement of indicia with high resolution into the wall of a hollow-form, molded plastisol part. The method includes the steps of preparing a plastisol graphic transfer by casting a base layer of plastisol onto a carrier sheet, printing indicia with pigmented plastisols onto the base layer of plastisol to form a graphic transfer, and over printing the graphic transfer with a body layer of plastisol. After each layer of plastisol is deposit, the layer cured by heating before depositing the next layer and the transfer is heated to cure the final, body layer. The transfer is applied to a selected inside surface of a conventional rotational mold by applying a high-solvent-content adhesive to the mold surface, stripping the plastisol transfer from the carrier sheet and applying it against the adhesive coated mold surface, and pressing the transfer against the adhesive-coated surface of the mold, permitting the applied transfer to dry over a short interval and then continuing with an otherwise conventional rotomolding or slush molding process to obtain a molded hollow form part having the indicia permanently fused into the wall of the part.
