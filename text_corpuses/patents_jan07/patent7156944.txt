title: Fusible adhesives crosslinkable by radiation

abstract: 
To obtain an adhesive having both a high initial adhesive capacity and high heat resistance, a fusible adhesive which can be cross-linked by radiation and a low tendency to creep is provided. The adhesive contains 0 to 40 weight percent of at least one elastomer which cannot be cross-linked by radiation, 15 to 40 weight percent of at least one compound containing at least two olefinic double bonds, and 20 to 85 weight percent of at least one tackifier. The adhesive is especially suitable for use on high speed labeling machines.
