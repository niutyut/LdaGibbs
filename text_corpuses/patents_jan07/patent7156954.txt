title: Soft tissue

abstract: 
Soft throughdried tissues, which are sufficiently soft to serve as premium bathroom tissues, can be made without the use of a Yankee dryer. The typical Yankee functions of building machine direction and cross-machine direction stretch are replaced by a wet end rush transfer and the throughdrying fabric design, respectively. It is particularly advantageous to form the tissue with chemimechanically treated fibers in at least one layer. The resulting tissues have high bulk (about 6 cubic centimeters per gram or greater) and low stiffness.
