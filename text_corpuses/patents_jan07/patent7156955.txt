title: Papermaking process using a specified NSF to silica-based particle ratio

abstract: 
The present invention refers to a process for the production of paper from a suspension containing cellulosic fibers, and optionally fillers, comprising adding to the suspension at least one cationic organic polymer and an aqueous silica-containing composition comprising an anionic naphthalene sulphonate formaldehyde condensate and anionic silica-based particles, the composition having a weight ratio of naphthalene sulphonate formaldehyde condensate to silica-based particles within the range of from 0.2:1 to 99:1, and containing naphthalene sulphonate formaldehyde condensate and silica-based particles in an amount of at least 0.01% by weight, based on the total weight of the aqueous silica-containing composition, and with the proviso that the composition contains substantially no cellulose-reactive sizing agent. The invention also encompasses an aqueous silica-containing composition and a method for preparation of an aqueous silica-containing compound.
