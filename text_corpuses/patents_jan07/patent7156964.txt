title: Sputtering target for phase-change memory, film for phase change memory formed by using the target, and method for producing the target

abstract: 
The present invention provides a sputtering target for a phase change memory and a phase change memory film formed with such a target, and the manufacturing method thereof, characterized in that the sputtering target is composed from elements of not less than a three component system and has as its principal component one or more components selected from stibium, tellurium and selenium, and the compositional deviation in relation to the intended composition is ?1.0 at % or less. This sputtering target for a phase change memory is capable of reducing, as much as possible, impurities that cause the reduction in the number of times rewriting can be conducted as a result of such impurities segregating and condensing in the vicinity of the boundary face of the memory point and non-memory point; in particular, impurity elements that affect the crystallization speed, reducing the compositional deviation of the target in relation to the intended composition, and improving the rewriting properties and crystallization speed of the phase change memory by suppressing the compositional segregation of the target.
