title: Self-cleansing media for rotating biological contactors

abstract: 
A self-cleansing media and systems incorporating the same, for a rotating biological contactor, are described. The media includes a disk having cones extending perpendicularly from the surface thereof. Two or more disks lock together, axially about a rotating central shaft, by connecting cones spaced throughout the disk surface having a socket at their base to receive the top of the corresponding connecting cone on the adjacent disk. The cones, by virtue of their length, space the disks a desired distance. The disks include disk segments that can link to one another along either straight and/or curved portions thereof. The geometry of the media provides free passage of the air and water during each revolution, and while the base disk slices through the air and water, the projecting cones or cylinders enter the air and water perpendicular to the direction of rotation and are washed and cleansed during each rotation.
