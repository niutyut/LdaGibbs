Each cylinder has a tube received therein and four first ribs connected between the tube and an inner periphery of the cylinder so as to define four first partitions for respectively receiving four curved magnetic pieces therein. Three second ribs are located in each tube and define three second partitions in each tube and each second partition has a plurality of mineral particles received therein. A first one of the three second ribs has an upper notch defined in a top edge thereof and a second one of the three second ribs has a bottom notch defined in a bottom edge thereof. A plurality of holes are defined through an area of the closed end of each cylinder and the area is located between the first one of the three second ribs and a third one of the three second ribs. A water tank is located at a top of a row of the cylinders and has a water permeable closed end. A cover is mounted to the top of the case and has an outlet fitting.
