title: Drinking water filter used with tap water and other water sources

abstract: 
A drinking water filter for filtering major water contaminates from tap water and other drinking water sources. The water filter a cylindrical cartridge for receiving a plurality of sponge filters used as dividers between different layers of filtration material and along a length of the cartridge. The sponge filters are designed to remove large and small sediments in the water from 1 to 100 microns in size and greater when the water is introduced through the cartridge. The layers of filtration material includes a layer of granulated zinc and copper alloy, a fine mesh carbon block, a layer of granulated ion exchange resin, a layer of granulated activated carbon and layer of granulated activated calcite. The carbon block and the granulated carbon material is used for removing chlorine, odor, color, cysts, protozoa and organic contaminants such as pesticides, herbicides, arsenic, mercury, and trihalomnethanes. The zinc and copper alloy is used for removing chlorine and heavy metals in the water and reducing bacteria in the water. The calcite is used to raise the pH in the filtered water when the pH is below neutral.
