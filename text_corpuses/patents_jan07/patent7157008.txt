title: Apparatus and process for water conditioning

abstract: 
A conditioning process and equipment are provided for removing hardness from water circulated in a system, such as an evaporative cooling system. A sidestream from such system is routed to a reaction chamber and back to the system. A conditioner is added to the sidestream before entering the reaction chamber and a buffer is added to the sidestream exiting the reaction chamber. Since some of the buffered sidestream is re-circulated, a fluid bed develops in the reaction chamber consisting of conditioner, buffer, precipitated solids and sidestream water. Continued sidestream water entry mixes with the fluid bed causing additional precipitation of solids. An upper outlet on the reaction chamber regulates the height of the fluid bed, and a drain provides for periodic discharge of the lower fluid bed. In another embodiment, a corrosion inhibitor blend is pre-mixed with the buffer, resulting in a softer, more readily drainable fluid bed.
