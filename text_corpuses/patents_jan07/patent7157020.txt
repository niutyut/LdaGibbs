title: Refrigerant compositions comprising performance enhancing additives

abstract: 
The present invention is related to refrigerant and lubricant compositions containing performance-enhancing additives. The performance enhancing additives are found to improve the energy efficiency and capacity of vapor compression refrigeration and air conditioning systems, which utilize hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants (e.g. HFC-134a ) and oxygenated refrigeration lubricants (e.g. POEs, PAGs and PVEs).
