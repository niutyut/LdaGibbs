title: Transparent coloring composition and color filter

abstract: 
The transparent coloring composition comprises a solvent and an organic-inorganic composite pigment comprising (i) fine white inorganic particles and an organic pigment adhered to the surface of the respective fine white inorganic particles, or (ii) fine white inorganic particles, a surface modifier coated on the surface of the respective fine white inorganic particles and an organic pigment adhered onto the surface modifier coating layer, primary particles of the composite pigment having an average particle diameter of 1 to 100 nm. The transparent coloring composition for color filter comprises the above transparent coloring composition and a transparent resin containing at least one acid group and/or latent acid group. The color filter is produced by applying a film-forming material made of the above transparent coloring composition for color filter on a substrate. The transparent coloring composition is suitable as a coloring composition for color filter because of excellent dispersibility and spectral properties. Further, the color filter produced from the transparent coloring composition can be suitably used as color filters for color liquid crystal displays (LCD) or the like owing to the excellent spectral properties.
