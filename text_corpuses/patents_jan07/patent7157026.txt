title: Method of manufacturing a trunk release handle for automobiles

abstract: 
An emergency trunk release handle for an automobile displays the graphics explaining the use and function of the handle by cutting out the material from the handle. Forming the emergency release handle from a phosphorescent plastic material that can be formed by a molding process, such as injection molding, the cut-out graphics show as darkened areas, when viewed in the dark confines of an automobile trunk, to provide a high degree of visibility for the graphics. The graphics are also visible when seen against the dark carpet in the interior of an opened trunk cavity. The formation of the graphics is accomplished by coring the mold in the configuration of the desired graphics and by forming the plastic material in the mold around the cores. The resultant handle structure is thus formed in a cost effective manner that reduces the process failure potential during the manufacturing of the handle.
