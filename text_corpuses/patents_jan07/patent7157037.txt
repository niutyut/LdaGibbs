title: Apparatus for making threaded articles in a plastic injection molding process

abstract: 
A Bi-directional rack assembly that rotates one column of threaded cores and unscrews threaded closures while moving in the forward direction. The Bi-directional rack then mechanically changes position to engage an adjacent column of rotating threaded cores and at the end of a second molding cycle rotates the threaded cores and unscrew threaded closures while moving in the reverse (reset) direction. A set of timed-advance devices are engaged by a smaller pinion gear and idler gear assemblies to the Bi-directional rack and as the Timed-Advance devices are activated, they allow pneumatic pistons to advance the stripper plate in time with the threaded closures as they are being unscrewed from the threaded cores. A second ?rapid advance? pneumatic piston eliminates the need for an external rapid rise camming feature. A rotating core comprising a stock, rotating core, a stock water-seal insert and a custom core top.
