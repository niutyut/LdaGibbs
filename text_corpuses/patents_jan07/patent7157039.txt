title: Method and apparatus for producing a curly puff extrudate

abstract: 
A process and apparatus for the production of a spiral or coil shaped puffed extrudate. A tube or other peripheral containment vessel is placed at the exit end of an extruder die. A force or resistance is then applied on the extrudate downstream of the glass transition point, thereby causing the extrudate to back up and coil in the containment vessel.
