title: Sample introduction device

abstract: 
A sample introduction device is provided that is particularly useful in the critical care environment for the anaerobic withdrawal of small volumes of arterial blood from a sample collection syringe and introduction thereof into a sample chamber of a sensor for analysis. The sample introduction device includes a Luer fitting adapted to mate an outlet of the container in a concentric orientation with an input aperture of the sample chamber. A tubular probe is adapted for concentric placement with both the outlet and inlet aperture, with a first end thereof extending into the syringe and a second end adapted for attachment to an air supply. The probe has a predetermined diameter sufficient to provide an annular clearance between the probe and each of the outlet and inlet aperture. A predetermined volume of air is injected through the probe into the container to displace a predetermined volume of sample therefrom, through the annular clearance into the sample chamber. Injecting air into the syringe through the probe to displace the sample therefrom, rather than drawing the sample into the probe, advantageously reduces or eliminates the need for washing the interior of the probe to relatively reduce the use of wash reagents.
