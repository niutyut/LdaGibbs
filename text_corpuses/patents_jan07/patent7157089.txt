title: Immune responses using compositions containing stress proteins

abstract: 
The present invention relates to a vaccine for inducing an immune response to an antigen in a vertebrate (e.g., mammal) comprising an antigen and all or a portion of a stress protein or all or a portion of a protein having an amino acid sequence sufficiently homologous to the amino acid sequence of the stress protein to induce the immune response against the antigen. In a particular embodiment, the present invention relates to vaccines and compositions which induce a CTL response in a mammal comprising an antigen and all or a portion of a stress protein. In another embodiment, the invention relates to vaccines and compositions which induce an immune response to an influenza virus in a mammal comprising an antigen of the influenza virus and all or a portion of one or more stress proteins. The invention also relates to vaccines and compositions for inducing a CTL response to a tumor-associated antigen comprising a tumor-associated antigen and all or a portion of the stress protein. The invention also relates to vaccines and composition for suppressing allergic immune responses to allergens comprising an allergen and all or a portion of a stress protein.
