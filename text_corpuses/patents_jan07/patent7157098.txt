title: Gene therapy of tumors using non-viral delivery system

abstract: 
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, comprising: (a) cationic lipids, wherein said lipids are a liposomal mixture of a diacyl-ethyl-phosphocholine and 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; and (b) a plasmid cDNA sequence encoding a protein having tumor suppressor or pro-apoptotic activity. This composition has a high gene transfection efficiency at non-toxic doses and is designed to transfect human bronchial premalignant lesions and early endo-bronchial malignancies. Also provided is a method of method of treating a cancerous or pre-cancerous condition of the respiratory tract in an individual in need of such treatment, comprising the step of administering to said individual a pharmacologically effective dose of a pharmaceutical composition, comprising: (a) cationic lipids, wherein said lipids are a liposomal mixture of a diacyl-ethyl-phosphocholine and 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; and (b) a plasmid cDNA sequence encoding a protein having tumor suppressor or pro-apoptotic activity.
