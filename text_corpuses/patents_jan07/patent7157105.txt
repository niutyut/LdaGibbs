title: Cranberry alkoxy esters as a delivery system for natural antioxidants

abstract: 
The present invention relates to cranberry seed oil derivatives derived by the reaction of polyoxyalkylene glycol compounds and cold pressed cranberry seed oil. The choice of cold pressed cranberry seed oil as a raw material in the preparation of the compounds of the present invention is critical, since it has been found that the cold pressed cranberry seed oil contains antioxidants, antimicrobial compounds and which when reacted with a polyoxyalkylene glycol compounds, result in products that deliver said actives to the skin and hair, resulting in protection of the skin and hair from environmental factors such as acid rain, ozone attack and UV degradation.
