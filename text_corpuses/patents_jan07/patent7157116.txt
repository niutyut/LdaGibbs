title: Method for the production of plane-parallel platelets by using organic separating agents

abstract: 
A new method is proposed for the production of plane-parallel platelets, comprising the steps a) vapor-deposition, at a pressure below atmospheric pressure, of a separating agent onto a carrier to produce a separating agent layer, b) vapor-deposition, at a pressure below atmospheric pressure, of at least one product layer onto the separating agent layer, c) dissolution of the separating agent layer in a solvent and production of a suspension in which the at least one product layer is present in the form of plane-parallel platelets, in which method the separating agent is selected from the group consisting of anthracene, anthraquinone, acetamidophenol, acetylsalicylic acid, camphoric anhydride, benzimidazole, benzene-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid, biphenyl-2,2-dicarboxylic acid, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-sulfone, dihydroxyanthraquinone, hydantoin, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid monohydrate, 4-hydroxycoumarin, 7-hydroxycoumarin, 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid, isophthalic acid, 4,4-methylene-bis-3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid, naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic anhydride, phthalimide and its potassium salt, phenol-phthalein, phenothiazine, saccharin and its salts, tetraphenylmethane, triphenylene, triphenylmethanol, and also mixtures of at least two of those substances. Separating agents that have been found to be especially suitable are aromatic compounds having at least one benzene ring. The present invention relates also to the use of the plane-parallel platelets thereby produced and also to the products obtainable using such methods.
