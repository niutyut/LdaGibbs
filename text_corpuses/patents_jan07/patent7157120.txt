title: Method for treating wood having a high extractive content

abstract: 
A method for treating wood having a high extractive content is disclosed. The method generally comprises applying to the wood a coating comprising a water-based polyurethane dispersion and a crosslinker. The dispersion can be cured and one or more additional coatings can be applied. The method results in reduced migration of extractives to the surface of the wood, improved adhesion and/or reduced staining of the wood.
