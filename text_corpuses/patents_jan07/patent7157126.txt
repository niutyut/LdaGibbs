title: Tear resistant bag for consumables

abstract: 
The invention is a tear-resistant container or bag made with a multilayer film comprising a composite structure of relatively inexpensive polymers and paper. The multilayer composite structure generally consists of an oriented polymer film layer adhered to a reinforcing scrim layer via a thermal bonding layer, to form a backing structure, and at least one paper layer adhered to the backing structure.
