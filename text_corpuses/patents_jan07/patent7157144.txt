title: Giant remnant polarization in laser ablated SrBi2Nb2O9 thin films on Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si  substrates

abstract: 
SrBiNbO(SBN) thin films are deposited on Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrates using off-axis pulsed laser deposition technique. Off-axis laser ablation avoids plasma damaging of the surface of SBN thin films and is favorable to grow films along the polarization axis (a?b plane). SBN thin films are grown at 350? C. substrate temperature, with 5 mm away from the plasma focus, and annealed at 750? C. for 1 hour in oxygen ambient. These SBN thin films exhibited giant remnant polarization (P) of 50 ?C/cmwith coercive field of 190 kV/cm. The fatigue endurance of these SBN thin films was measured at 400 kV/cm and showed minimal (<20%) polarization degradation of up to 10switching cycles. The leakage current density of SBN thin films was found to be about 2?10up to an applied field of 100 kV/cm. The above-mentioned properties of off-axis deposited SBN thin films, makes it a good material for NVRAM devices.
