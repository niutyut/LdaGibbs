title: Surface-modified glass-ceramics and their preparation

abstract: 
The present invention relates to a product, comprising a body which is delimited by a surface, of a lithium aluminosilicate-based glass-ceramic, as well as to its method of preparation. Characteristically, said glass-ceramic has, on at least one part of said surface, a surface layer the degree of crystallization of which is greater than that of said glass-ceramic within said body.
