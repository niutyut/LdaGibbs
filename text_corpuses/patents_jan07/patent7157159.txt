title: Infrared ray cut filter and methods for manufacturing the same

abstract: 
A reflective-type infrared ray cut filter and associated manufacturing method wherein the time and cost of manufacture are reduced and manufacturing efficiency is improved are provided. In the infrared ray cut filter  comprising a multilayer membrane  composed of no less than 16 but no more than 32 layers of a high-refractive index thin membrane  and a low-refractive index thin membrane  laminated in an alternating fashion and formed on a glass substrate , the first layer from the side of the glass substrate  is a high-refractive index thin membrane  and the last layer is a low-refractive index thin membrane , and where the design wavelength is deemed ?, the first and second layers are formed to have an optical thickness of no less than ?/4, the third layer through a prescribed layer are formed to have an optical thickness of no more than ?/4, the layers between the prescribed layer and the last layer are formed to have an optical thickness of no less than ?/4, and the last layer is formed to have an optical thickness of no more than ?/4.
