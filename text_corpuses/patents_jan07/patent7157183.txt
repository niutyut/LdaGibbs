title: Proton conductor, production method thereof, and electrochemical device using the same

abstract: 
A proton conductor mainly contains a carbonaceous material derivative, such as, a fullerene derivative, a carbon cluster derivative, or a tubular carbonaceous material derivative in which groups capable of transferring protons, for example, ?OH groups or ?OSOH groups are introduced to carbon atoms of the carbonaceous material derivative. The proton conductor is produced typically by compacting a powder of the carbonaceous material derivative. The proton conductor is usable, even in a dry state, in a wide temperature range including ordinary temperature. In particular, the proton conductor mainly containing the carbon cluster derivative is advantageous in increasing the strength and extending the selection range of raw materials. An electrochemical device, such as, a fuel cell, that employs the proton conductor is not limited by atmospheric conditions and can be of a small and simple construction. The proton conductor may contain a polymer in addition to the carbonaceous material derivative, which conductor can be formed, typically by extrusion molding, into a thin film having a large strength, a high gas permeation preventive ability, and a good proton conductivity.
