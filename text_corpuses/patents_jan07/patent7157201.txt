title: Toner for developing latent electrostatic image, container having the same, developer using the same, process for developing using the same, image-forming process using the same, image-forming apparatus using the same, and image-forming process cartridge using the same

abstract: 
A toner for developing a latent electrostatic image including a base of toner particle which contains a binder resin and a coloring agent, and an external additive. Herein, a plurality of the base of toner particle has a volume average particle diameter (Dv) of 3 ?m to 7 ?m, a ratio (Dv/Dn) of the volume average particle diameter (Dv) to a number average particle diameter (Dn) is 1.01 to 1.25, a plurality of the base of toner particle contains 15% by number or less of the base of toner particle having a particle diameter of 0.6 ?m to 2.0 ?m, a plurality of the base of toner particle has a circularity of 0.930 to 0.990 on average, the binder resin contains a modified polyester resin, and the toner contains 0.3 parts by weight to 5.0 parts by weight of the external additive, relative to 100 parts by weight of the base of toner particle.
