title: Image forming method and image forming apparatus for planographic printing plate

abstract: 
The present invention is to provide an image forming method for a planographic printing plate. In the method, a planographic printing plate precursor in which an image recording layer containing a thermally sensitive and thermally curable material is formed on an aluminium support is scanning exposed with a relatively weak laser beam, and a latent image is formed, which is composed of an image recording layer part whose surface layer is thermally cured corresponding to an image and an unexposed image recording layer part which is not thermally cured. The unexposed image recording layer part which is not thermally cured is then removed by simple water development. Then, by carrying out heating, the whole image recording layer part remaining on the surface of the aluminum support is uniformly cured and firmly fixed. The invention also provides an image forming apparatus for a planographic printing plate.
