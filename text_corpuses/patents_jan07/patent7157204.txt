title: Soluble polyimide for photosensitive polyimide precursor and photosensitive polyimide precursor composition comprising the soluble polyimide

abstract: 
A soluble polyimide for a photosensitive polyimide precursor and a photosensitive polyimide precursor composition including the soluble polyimide, wherein the soluble polyimide contains hydroxyl and acetyl moieties and at least one reactive end-cap group at one or both ends of the polymer chain. The photosensitive polyimide precursor composition comprises the soluble polyimide, a polyamic acid containing at least one reactive end-cap group at one or both ends of the polymer chain, a photo acid generator (PAG) and optionally a dissolution inhibitor. Since the polyimide film of the present invention exhibits excellent thermal, electric and mechanical properties, it can be used as insulating films or protective films for various electronic devices. A pattern with a high resolution may be formed even on the polyamide film having a thickness of above 10 ?m.
