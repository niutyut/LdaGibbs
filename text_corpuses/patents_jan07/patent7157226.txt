title: Sequences of hepatitis C virus genotypes and their use as therapeutic and diagnostic agents

abstract: 
The present invention relates to a polynucleic acid composition comprising or consisting of at least one polynucleic acid containing 8 or more contiguous nucleotides corresponding to a nucleotide sequence from the region spanning positions 417 to 957 of the Core/E1 region of HCV type 3; and/or the region spanning positions 4664 to 4730 of the NS3 region of HCV type 3; and/or the region spanning positions 4892 to 5292 of the NS3/4 region of HCV type 3; and/or the region spanning positions 8023 to 8235 of the NS5 region of the BR36 subgroup of HCV type 3a; and or the coding region of HCV type 4a starting at nucleotide 379 in the core region; and/or the coding region of HCV type 4; and/or the coding region of HCV type 5, with said nucleotide numbering being with respect to the numbering of HCV nucleic acids as shown in Table 1, and with said polynucleic acids containing at least one nucleotide difference with known HCV type 1, and/or HCV type 2 genomes in the above-indicated regions, or the complement thereof.
