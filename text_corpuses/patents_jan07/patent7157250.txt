title: Glutamic acid receptor and utilization thereof

abstract: 
An agonist or antagonist of glutamic acid or an allosteric modulator is screened by reacting a glutamic acid receptor protein having the following properties with a substance binding thereto in the presence of a test substance and detecting the inhibition or promotion of the reaction:
(A) it has a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain common to those of type 4 metabotropic glutamic acid receptor protein, or
(B) it has an extracellular domain by about 316 or 327 amino acid residues shorter than that of the type 4 metabotropic glutamic acid receptor protein.
