title: Lightweight chamber having variable configurations and a method for making such

abstract: 
An anabolic chamber constructed of a plastic with additives to create desirable characteristics such as resistance to corrosion and bacteria growth. The anabolic chamber has a double-wall structure with internal support ribs for creating a water jacket for facilitating maintaining temperature control within the chamber. Features such as handles, mounting blocks and surface detail are created integral to the anabolic chamber.
