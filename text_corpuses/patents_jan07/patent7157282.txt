title: Quality control material for reagentless measurement of analytes

abstract: 
A method of monitoring calibration of a spectrophotometric apparatus having one or more than one calibration algorithm for one or more than one analyte. This method involves measuring an absorbance of a quality control material to obtain a measurement, calculating one or more than one concentration value from the measurement using the one or more than one calibration algorithm, and comparing the one or more than one concentration value with an assigned value given to the quality control material for each of the one or more than one analyte. The quality control material exhibits an absorbance spectra having a negative slope for a continuous spectral segment from about 5 nm to about 400 nm in length, or a wavelength therebetween. A reagentless method for determining the concentration of one or more than one analyte in a sample in a spectrophotometric apparatus containing one or more than one primary calibration algorithm is also provided. Also provided is a method for selecting one or more than one substance as a quality control material for monitoring one or more than one primary calibration algorithm on a spectrophotometric apparatus. Also described is a quality control material for mimicking two or more than two analytes, containing one or more than one substance having a combined absorption spectrum exhibiting a negative slope for a continuous spectral segment of from about 5 nm to 400 nm in length, or a wavelength therebetween.
