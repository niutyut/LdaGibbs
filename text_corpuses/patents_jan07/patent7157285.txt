title: Automated method for treatment of samples on solid supports

abstract: 
The automated sample-on-solid-support processing system of the present invention comprises a computer-based control unit and a main unit comprising a variable-speed centrifuge having an openable vacuum-tight chamber and a centrifuge rotor with a plurality of multi-sample holding positions, a liquid solvent supply subsystem which feeds solvent to a plurality of dispensing stations in the centrifuge chamber, a temperature control subsystem, and a vacuum subsystem. A sample/collection container includes a plurality of wells, each for separating a sample from its solid support when solvent is dispensed into the wells and the centrifuge is activated at a low speed. Operation of the centrifuge at high speed concentrates the cleaved sample in collection wells. In the preferred embodiment bar code reader or other identification means, preferably a non-contact reader, can be included in the chamber to allow sample carriers to be identified.
