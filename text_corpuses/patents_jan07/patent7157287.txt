title: Method of substrate surface treatment for RRAM thin film deposition

abstract: 
A method of fabricating a CMR thin film for use in a semiconductor device includes preparing a CMR precursor in the form of a metal acetate based acetic acid solution; preparing a wafer; placing a wafer in a spin-coating chamber; spin-coating and heating the wafer according to the following: injecting the CMR precursor into a spin-coating chamber and onto the surface of the wafer in the spin-coating chamber; accelerating the wafer to a spin speed of between about 1500 RPM to 3000 RPM for about 30 seconds; baking the wafer at a temperature of about 180? C. for about one minute; ramping the temperature to about 230? C.; baking the wafer for about one minute at the ramped temperature; annealing the wafer at about 500? C. for about five minutes; repeating said spin-coating and heating steps at least three times; post-annealing the wafer at between about 500? C. to 600? C. for between about one to six hours in dry, clean air; and completing the semiconductor device.
