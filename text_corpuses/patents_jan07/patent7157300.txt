title: Fabrication of thin film germanium infrared sensor by bonding to silicon wafer

abstract: 
A method of fabricating a thin film germanium photodetector includes preparing a silicon substrate; fabricating a CMOS device on the silicon substrate; preparing a germanium substrate; preparing surfaces of each substrate for bonding; bonding the germanium substrate to the CMOS-bearing silicon substrate to form a bonded structure; removing a portion of the germanium substrate from the bonded structure; forming a PIN diode in the germanium substrate; removing a portion of the germanium layer by etching; and completing the germanium photo detector.
