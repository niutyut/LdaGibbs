title: Methods for packaging microfeature devices and microfeature devices formed by such methods

abstract: 
Methods for packaging microfeature devices on and/or in microfeature workpieces at the wafer level and microfeature devices that are formed using such methods are disclosed herein. In one embodiment, a method comprises providing a workpiece including a substrate having a plurality of microelectronic dies on and/or in the substrate. The individual dies include integrated circuitry and pads electrically coupled to the integrated circuitry. The method then includes depositing an underfill layer onto a front side of the substrate. The method also includes selectively forming apertures in the underfill layer to expose the pads at the front side of the substrate. The method further includes depositing a conductive material into the apertures and in electrical contact with the corresponding pads. In one aspect of this embodiment, the underfill layer is a photoimageable material.
