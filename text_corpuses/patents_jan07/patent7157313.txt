title: Epoxy resin composition and semiconductor device using thereof

abstract: 
The present invention provides an epoxy resin composition for packaging a semiconductor device, characterized in having improved mold releasability during a molding process, continuous-moldability and improved solder resistance. According to the present invention, there is provided an epoxy resin composition for packaging the semiconductor element, obtained by formulating: (A) an epoxy resin; (B) a phenolic resin; (C) a curing accelerator; (D) an inorganic filler; and (E) an oxidized polyethylene wax having a drop point within a range of from 60 to 140 degree C., an acid value within a range of from 10 to 100 (mg KOH/g), a number average molecular weight within a range of from 500 to 20,000, and a mean particle size within a range of from 5 to 100 ?m, wherein at least one of (A) epoxy resin and (B) phenolic resin is a novolac structured resin having biphenylene structure, and wherein content of (E) oxidized polyethylene wax in epoxy resin composition is within a range of from 0.01 to 1 % wt.
