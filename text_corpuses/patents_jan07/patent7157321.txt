title: Semiconductor device and method for manufacturing the same

abstract: 
A semiconductor device that can be manufactured with a reduced cost by decreasing the number of masks is disclosed, and a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device is disclosed. The method for manufacturing the semiconductor device comprises the steps of: forming a semiconductor layer  having a source and a drain regions , and LDD regions ; a gate insulating film ; and a gate electrode ; forming a first and a second interlayer insulating films  over the gate electrode  and the gate insulating film ; forming contact holes to these interlayer insulating films so as to be located over each of the source region and the drain region; and an opening portion to these interlayer insulating films so as to be located over the gate electrode and the LDD region; forming a second gate electrode by a conductive film in the opening portion so as to cover the gate electrode and the LDD region; and a pixel electrode over the second interlayer insulating film; removing the gate insulating film in the contact hole; and forming wirings  connected to each the source region and the drain region.
