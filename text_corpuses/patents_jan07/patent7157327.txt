title: Void free, silicon filled trenches in semiconductors

abstract: 
The present invention provides methods of producing substantially void-free trench structures. After deposition of an a-Si or polysilicon layer in a trench formed in a semiconductor, the a-Si or polysilicon is exposed to hydrogen at an elevated temperature.
