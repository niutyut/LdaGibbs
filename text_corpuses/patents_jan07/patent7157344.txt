title: Vapor-phase growth method, semiconductor manufacturing method and semiconductor device manufacturing method

abstract: 
In a vapor-phase growth method in which a silicon-germanium mixed crystal layer is deposited on a semiconductor substrate, the vapor-phase growth method comprises a first step of introducing silicon raw material gas into a reaction furnace in such a manner that a silicon raw material gas partial pressure increases in proportion to a time to thereby deposit a first semiconductor layer of a silicon layer on the semiconductor substrate under reduced pressure, a second step of introducing silicon raw material gas and germanium raw material gas into the reaction furnace in such a manner that a desired germanium concentration may be obtained to thereby deposit a second semiconductor layer of a silicon-germanium mixed crystal layer on the first semiconductor layer under reduced pressure and a third step of introducing silicon raw material gas into the reaction furnace under reduced pressure to thereby deposit a third semiconductor layer of a silicon layer on the second semiconductor layer. Thus, there can be obtained a semiconductor layer in which a misfit dislocation can be improved.
