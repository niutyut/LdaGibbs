title: Method of forming metal interconnection layer of semiconductor device

abstract: 
Various methods are provided for forming metal interconnection layers of semiconductor devices. One exemplary method for forming a metal interconnection layer of a semiconductor device includes forming an interlayer dielectric layer on a substrate, forming a hard mask layer on the interlayer dielectric layer, wherein the hard mask layer serves as an anti-reflection layer, depositing and patterning a first photoresist layer to form a first photoresist pattern on the hard mask layer, forming a partial via hole in the interlayer dielectric layer by etching the hard mask layer and the interlayer dielectric layer using the first photoresist pattern as an etching mask, removing the first photoresist pattern, depositing a second photoresist layer to fill the partial via hole with photoresist material and patterning the second photoresist layer to form a second photoresist pattern that defines a trench interconnection area which overlaps at least portion of the partial via hole, etching the hard mask layer using the second photoresist pattern as an etching mask to form a hard mask pattern, completely removing the second photoresist pattern and the photoresist material in the partial via hole, etching the interlayer dielectric layer using the hard mask pattern as an etching mask to form the trench interconnection area and to extend the partial via hole to form a full via hole, and filling the full via hole and the trench interconnection area with a conductive material.
