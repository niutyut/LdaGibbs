title: Outdoor fabric

abstract: 
A unique and novel durable environmentally stabilized, waterproof, and moisture vapor permeable composite sheet material is described that includes a moisture permeable monolithic film, coating, or film/nonwoven laminate, that is held in close proximity to one or more layers of durable strength enhancing fabrics. The strength enhancing fabrics can include cotton, polyester, cotton/polyester blends, acrylic, and other synthetic materials and blends. The breathable monolithic film or coating is preferably polyester or polyurethane based. The breathable and durability enhancing layers are preferably laminated using hot melt adhesives such as polyester-based powder bond adhesives or using solvent-based polyurethane adhesives. The disclosed composite sheet material is uniquely designed for use in tents, tarps, mooring and trailerable boat and personal watercraft (PWC) covers, marine and outdoor furniture upholstery, inflatables, and other outdoor applications requiring waterproofness and breathability during extended outdoor exposure.
