title: Ion triggerable, cationic polymers, a method of making same and items using same

abstract: 
The present invention is directed to ion triggerable, water-dispersible cationic polymers. The present invention is also directed to a method of making ion triggerable, water-dispersible cationic polymers and their applicability as binder compositions. The present invention is further directed to fiber-containing fabrics and webs comprising ion triggerable, water-dispersible binder compositions and their applicability in water-dispersible personal care products, such as wet wipes.
