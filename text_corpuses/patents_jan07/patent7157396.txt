title: Dielectric ceramic composition and method of production and electronic device of the same

abstract: 
A method of production of a reduction resistant dielectric ceramic composition having a superior low frequency dielectric characteristic and further improved in accelerated lifetime of insulation resistance, specifically a method of production of a dielectric ceramic composition containing a main component including a dielectric oxide of a specific composition, a first subcomponent including a V oxide, a second subcomponent containing an Al oxide, a third subcomponent containing an Mn oxide, and a fourth subcomponent containing a specific sintering aid in a specific ratio, including a step of mixing at least part of the materials of the subcomponents excluding one or both of at least the material of the third subcomponent and material of the fourth subcomponent with the starting materials prepared for obtaining the material of the main component to prepare the pre-reaction material, a step of causing the prepared pre-reaction material to react to obtain a reacted material, and a step of mixing the materials of the subcomponents excluded when preparing the pre-reaction material with the obtained reacted material to obtain a dielectric ceramic composition.
