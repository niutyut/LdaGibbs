title: Amine organoborane complex initiated polymerizable compositions containing siloxane polymerizable components

abstract: 
In one embodiment the invention is a polymerizable composition comprising a) an organoborane amine complex; b) one or more of monomers, oligomers or polymers having olefinic unsaturation which is capable of polymerization by free radical polymerization; c) one or more compounds, oligomers or prepolymers having a siloxane backbone and reactive moieties capable of polymerization; and d) a catalyst for the polymerization of the one or more compounds, oligomers or prepolymers having a siloxane backbone and reactive moieties capable of polymerization. This composition may further comprise a compound which causes the organoborane amine complex to disassociate. In a preferred embodiment, the two part composition further comprises a compound which is reactive with both the b) one or more of monomers, oligomers or polymers having olefinic unsaturation which is capable of polymerization by free radical polymerization; and the c) one or more compounds, oligomers or prepolymers having a siloxane backbone and reactive moieties capable of polymerization. This composition can be polymerized by contacting the two parts of the composition. In another embodiment the invention is an organoborane amine complex comprising an alkyl borane having ligands which are alkyl, cycloalkyl or both and an amino siloxane.
