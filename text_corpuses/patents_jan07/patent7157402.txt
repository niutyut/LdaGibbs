title: HCMS carbon capsule, electrocatalysts for fuel cell supported by HCMS carbon capsule, and method of preparing the same

abstract: 
The present invention provides a bimodal porous carbon capsule with a hollow core and a mesoporous shell structure, which can be employed as an electrocatalyst support for a fuel cell; electrocatalysts for the fuel cell using the bimodal porous carbon capsule, and a method of preparing the same.
The electrocatalyst according to the present invention has higher catalysis activity as compared with the Pt?Ru or Pt catalyst supported by the conventional carbon black, so that the performance of the fuel cell is enhanced, and it can be easily prepared in an aqueous solution state. According to the present invention, the porous carbon support employed as the support for the catalyst has excellent conductivity and a high surface area, so that the loaded catalyst can be prepared with a smaller amount than that of the conventional carbon black. Further, metal particles having an extremely fine size of 2?3 nm are uniformly distributed on the support, so that the area of an active site at which catalysis reaction is performed is increased, thereby increasing the catalyst activity with respect to the oxidation reaction of the fuel such as methanol, ethanol, hydrogen, etc. Also, a fine pore of a porous carbon support secures a fuel dispersing passage, so that the fuel including alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or the like, hydrogen, etc. can be easily transferred and dispersed, thereby efficiently performing its oxidation-reduction reaction. On the other hand, an air electrode can efficiently function as the catalyst due to the same principle.
