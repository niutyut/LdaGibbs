title: Perfluoropolyether ester compound, lubricant and magnetic recording medium

abstract: 
A novel perfluoropolyether derivative, which has at least one ester bond and is useful as a lubricant with a decomposition temperature of 300? C. or more, is obtained by an esterification reaction between a perfluoropolyether diol having hydroxyl groups at both ends thereof and represented by the formula (1) and a perfluoropolyether dicarboxylic acid having carboxyl groups at both ends thereof and represented by the formula (2):

HOCH?R?CHOH??(1)

HOOC?R??COOH??(2)

wherein each of R and R? is a perfluoroether group.
