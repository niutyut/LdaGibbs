title: Odor neutralizers

abstract: 
This invention relates to odor neutralizers comprising esters of the formula (I) wherein Ris an alkyl radical with 1 to 4 carbon atoms which can optionally contain a double bond; Ris a hydrogen or an alkyl radical with 1 to 3 carbon atoms which can optionally contain a double bond; Ris a hydrogen or a methyl radical substituted by the alkyl radicals Rand R; Ris a hydrogen, a methyl radical or an acyloxy radical of the general formula O?CO?Rwherein Rhas the abovementioned meaning; R, R, R, Rand Rare identical or different and is hydrogen or methyl; Ris a hydrogen and Rand Rcan together represent a single carbon bond or a methylene or an ethylene bridge,with the proviso that i) in the case of cyclohexyl esters in which R=methyl, R=isopropyl, R=methyl and R=hydrogen, the substituents Rand Rare arranged in a cis relationship to each other; ii) in the case of cyclohexyl esters in which R=isopropenyl, R=methyl and R=hydrogen, the substituent Ris an alkyl group with at least two C atoms; iii) in the case of acyclic monofunctional esters, the substituent Ris an alkyl group with at least two C atoms; and iv) in the case of cyclohexyl esters in which R, R, R=hydrogen and R, R, R=methyl, the substituent Ris methyl, ethyl, propyl or 1-propen-1-yl.
