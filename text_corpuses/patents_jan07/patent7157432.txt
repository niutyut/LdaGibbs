title: Tetraphenylbacteriochlorin derivatives and compositions containing the same

abstract: 
Provided is a tetraphenylbacteriochlorin derivative represented by the formula (I):


[wherein R, R, Rand R, independently from each other, are a residue of a monosaccharide represented by the formulae:



(wherein, R is a hydrogen or a protecting group)], or its salt. The tetraphenylbacteriochlorin derivative or its salt has a large molar extinction coefficient at long wavelengths which are expected to have a high tissue-penetrating property, and exhibits high selectivity to tumor cells and hydrophilicity.
