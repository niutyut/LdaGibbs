title: Complex of ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitor, a cyclodextrin, and ethanol

abstract: 
A ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitor complex formed from a ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a substituted cyclodextrin, and ethanol is provided. The complex has unexpectedly high aqueous solubility of the ras-farnesyltransferase inhibitor, improved dissolution, enhanced stability and is essentially free of particulate matter.
