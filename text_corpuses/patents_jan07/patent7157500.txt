title: Nitrosylation of protein SH groups and amino acid residues as a therapeutic modality

abstract: 
Nitrosylation of proteins and amino acid groups enables selective regulation of protein function, and also endows the proteins and amino acids with additional smooth muscle relaxant and platelet inhibitory capabilities. Thus, the invention relates to novel compounds achieved by nitrosylation of protein thiols. Such compounds include: S-nitroso-t-PA, S-nitroso-cathepsin; S-nitroso-lipoprotein; and S-nitroso-immunoglobulin. The invention also relates to therapeutic use of S-nitroso-protein compounds for regulating protein function, cellular metabolism and effecting vasodilation, platelet inhibition, relaxation of non-vascular smooth muscle, and increasing blood oxygen transport by hemoglobin and myoglobin. The compounds are also used to deliver nitric oxide in its most bioactive form in order to achieve the effects described above, or for in vitro nitrosylation of molecules present in the body. The invention also relates to the nitrosylation of oxygen, carbon and nitrogen moieties present on proteins and amino acids, and the use thereof to achieve the above physiological effects.
