title: Method of delaminating a graphite structure with a coating agent in a supercritical fluid

abstract: 
The present invention involves a method of delaminating a graphite structure. The method comprises diffusing a coating agent in a supercritical fluid between layered particles of a graphite structure defining contacted graphite particles and catastrophically depressurizing the supercritical fluid to form delaminated graphite particles.
