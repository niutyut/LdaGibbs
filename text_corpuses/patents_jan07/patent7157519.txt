title: High molar mass polyurethane dispersions

abstract: 
A water-dispersible polyurethane resin comprising building blocks derived from polyisocyanates A, polyols B having a number-average molar mass Mof at least 400 g/mol, where appropriate, low molar mass polyols C with Mbelow 400 g/mol, compounds D which possess at least two groups which are reactive toward isocyanate groups and at least one group which is capable of forming anions, low molar mass polyols E which in relation to isocyanate groups carry no further reactive groups, compounds F, which are monofunctional toward isocyanates or contain active hydrogen of different reactivity and are different from the compounds E and also, where appropriate, compounds G, which are different from B, C, D, E and F and contain at least two groups which are reactive with NCO groups, wherein the number-average molar mass Mof the polyurethane resin is at least 10 kg/mol, its weight-average molar mass Mis at least 20 kg/mol, and its acid number is from 20 to 50 mg/g; a process for its preparation; and its use as a binder.
