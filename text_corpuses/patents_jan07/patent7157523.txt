title: Ring-opened polynorbornenes

abstract: 
The disclosure is directed to a partially hydrogenated ring-opened polynorbornene and a process for making the same. The ring-opened polynorbornene is low in birefringence, high in wavelength dependency about birefringence and excellent in transparency and heat resistance.
