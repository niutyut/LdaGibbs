title: ?-Halogenated acid esters with polyvalent alcohols as atom transfer radical polymerization initiators

abstract: 
The invention relates to ?-halocarboxylic acid esters of polyhydric, at least trihydric, alcohols, which can be used as initiators for ATRP. Using those initiators it is possible to prepare block copolymers having branched structures.
