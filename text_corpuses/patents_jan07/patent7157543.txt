title: Block polyorganosiloxane block organomer polymers and release agents

abstract: 
A polyorganosiloxane block hydrocarbyl block polymer having utility as a release agent in toner fusing systems. The polymer has one or more polar linkages, with each such linkage bonding a polyorganosiloxane block and a hydrocarbyl block, and also including a polar functionality.
