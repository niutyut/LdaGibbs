title: Bioprocess for the production of recombinant anti-botulinum toxin antibody

abstract: 
A process for producing recombinant anti-botulinum toxin antibody comprising the steps of fermenting recombinant cells in broth, concentrating the cells by removing the broth, crushing the concentrated cells, separating a permeate derived from the crushed cells from cell debris, purifying a recombinant antibotulinum antibody (Fab) from said permeate, and separating said Fab from impurities by diafiltration.
