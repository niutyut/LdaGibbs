title: Crystalline acid salts of cefdinir and process for preparing cefdinir using same

abstract: 
High purity cefdinir is prepared in a high yield by a process comprising the steps of: treating a crystalline salt of a cefdinir intermediate with a formic acid-sulfuric acid mixture or a formic acid-methanesulfonic acid mixture to obtain a crystalline salt of cefdinir and reacting the crystalline salt with a base in a solvent.
