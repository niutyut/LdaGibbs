title: Bloom-resistant benzotriazole UV absorbers and compositions stabilized therewith

abstract: 
Benzotriazole UV absorbers substituted with a ultra long ester or amide moiety wherein the ester or amide group is a hydrocarbyl group of 25 to 100 carbon atoms or is a group of alkyl of 25 to 100 carbon atoms interrupted by 5 to 39 oxygen atoms and terminated with an omega-OH or an omega-OR group exhibit excellent stabilization efficacy while they concomitantly do not bloom when incorporated into polyolefin films. These benzotriazole UV absorbers also provide excellent protection to white, dyed, dipped, unscented and/or scented candle wax from discoloration and degradation.
