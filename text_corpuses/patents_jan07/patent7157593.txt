title: Ferrous picrate produced by a process utilizing a non-powdered metallic iron

abstract: 
A fuel additive containing ferrous picrate produced by a process involving placing a non-powdered metallic iron, such as wire composed of an alloy of iron or steel wool, in any solution of picric acid in a solvent that is known in the art for reacting with iron to produce ferrous picrate. The wire can be suspended in the solution or placed upon the bottom of a reaction vessel that holds the solution. Preferably the wire is loosely coiled, at least when placed upon the bottom of a reaction vessel. Also preferably, after a concentrated fuel additive has been prepared, to the concentrate is added so much of a pre-mix solution produced by the steps of (a) dissolving picric acid in the same kind of solvent that was utilized to produce the solution into which the steel wool was placed and (b) removing water from the precursor to the pre-mix solution thus produced and so much of the same kind of alcohol that was utilized to produce the solution into which the steel wool was placed that the final product produced thereby contains approximately 1.9 percent free picric acid and 15 to 16 percent of the alcohol.
