title: Process for recovering methanol

abstract: 
A process for recovering methanol from mixtures containing methanol and water, comprising multistage evaporation with heat integration, wherein the pressure is reduced from each stage to the next, and a downstream series of distillation stages with heat integration, wherein the pressure is increased from each stage to the next. The process reduces the amount of energy required for methanol recovery.
