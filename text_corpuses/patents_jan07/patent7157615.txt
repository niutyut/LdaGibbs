title: Production of biofilaments in transgenic animals

abstract: 
Disclosed is a method for the recombinant production of biofilaments, such as spider silk or insect fibroins, using transgenic animals which secrete the biofilaments in their milk and/or urine, and transgenic cells which secrete the biofilaments into culture media. Such a method is useful for producing large quantities of biofilament material. Also disclosed is a nucleic acid molecule for generating such transgenic animals.
