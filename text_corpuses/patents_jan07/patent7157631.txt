title: Inbred maize line NP2467

abstract: 
An inbred maize line, designated NP2467 having a lower ear height and a white versus a red cob compared to B73. NP2467 has better resistance to Gray Leaf Spot and Southern Leaf Blight than B73 and because of its improved plant health, NP2467 has much better Stay Green than B73. When NP2467 is crossed with other inbred maize lines produces hybrids with greater yield, stalk strength, emergence rating and push test percentage. This invention further relates to the seeds of inbred maize line NP2467, to the plants of inbred maize line NP2467, to hybrids made using the inbred maize plant NP2467 and another inbred maize plant, and to methods for producing a maize plant by crossing the inbred line NP2467 with itself or another maize line.
