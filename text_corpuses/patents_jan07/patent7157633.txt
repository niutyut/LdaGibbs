title: Simulated stringed instrument practice device

abstract: 
A simulated stringed musical instrument practice device having integrally formed longitudinal ridges simulating strings is herein disclosed. The present invention generally comprises an elongated section of material that is similar in shape to the neck of a conventional stringed instrument. The elongated section has a flat surface fashioned thereon having transverse ridges simulating frets as well as longitudinal ridges integrally attached thereto simulating strings. The frets are spaced progressively longer distances apart in order to more accurately simulate the fret board of a conventional stringed instrument. Optionally, the present invention may also provide utility as a computer keyboard wrist rest. Non-slip footings are provided for attachment to the flat surface in order to provide for secure placement adjacent the keyboard of a computer in a manner similar to conventional wrist rests. A combination simulated stringed instrument and computer keyboard wrist rest having a multi-layered elongated section which deforms to the shape of a user's wrist while used as a keyboard wrist rest is also disclosed.
