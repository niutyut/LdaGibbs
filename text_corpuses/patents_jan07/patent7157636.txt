title: Two-legged cymbal support for use with a cymbal assembly

abstract: 
A two-legged cymbal support for a cymbal assembly includes two legs, two connecting ribs and two clamping devices. First distal ends of the two legs are pivotally connected to one of the clamping devices and second distal ends of the two legs are supported on the ground. First distal ends of the two connecting ribs are pivotally connected to the other one of the two clamping devices and second distal ends of the two connecting ribs are pivotally connected to the two legs. Each clamping device has a first arcuate recess and a second arcuate recess complimentarily corresponding to the first arcuate recess such that when the first and second arcuate recesses are combined to form a circular space, the pole of the cymbal assembly is clamped therebetween. When the first and second arcuate recesses are separate, the pole is easily removed.
