title: System and methodology for musical communication and display

abstract: 
A workstation system produces a display presentation of a selected performance composition (e.g., a musical composition) responsive to composition data and responsive to one or both of input variables and a selected operating mode. The workstation can communicate with one or more external devices, such as other workstations, etc. The display system provides for selection of original compositions, creation of derivative compositions, distribution of compositions, monitoring of each performer's performance, group virtual performances, and for local and distributed retrieval and editing, which for music includes things such as changing keys, pitch, tempo, and other parameters. The musical composition's transformation can be performed locally or at the central or distributed music database. The musical composition data can be transposed via a controller, and can be transmitted to a plurality of the individual workstations that then display the musical composition. In one embodiment, a display system for use by a plurality of users provides a plurality of display presentations of a selected musical composition. The system is comprised of a plurality of individual workstations, each workstation comprising a communication interface providing for communications with the respective workstation of music data representative of the selected musical composition, memory for locally storing the data responsive to the communications interface, and a display apparatus provides a local visual display presentation representative of the selected musical composition responsive to the stored data. The system further provides for synchronizing the presentation on the plurality of local visual display presentations of the selected musical composition.
