title: Handhole reinforcing frame for round utility poles

abstract: 
A frame for reinforcing a handhole of a round metallic utility pole, includes a generally elliptical body defining a major axis and a minor axis and forming a generally elliptical outer periphery, and a generally elliptical inner periphery bordering an opening extending through front and back sides of the body, the opening defining a center axis of the frame. A flange is formed integrally with the body and projects forwardly therefrom at a location spaced inwardly from the outer periphery, wherein the flange is separated from the outer periphery by a forwardly facing shoulder surface of the body. The flange includes an outer flank facing outwardly and intersecting the shoulder surface, wherein the flange outer flank forms an oblique angle with the center axis as seen in a sectional view taken along the major axis, and lies substantially parallel to the center axis as seen in a sectional view taken along the minor axis.
