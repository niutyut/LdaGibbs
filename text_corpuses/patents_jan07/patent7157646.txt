title: Circuitized substrate with split conductive layer, method of making same, electrical assembly utilizing same, and information handling system utilizing same

abstract: 
A circuitized substrate which includes a plurality of contiguous open segments which define facing edge portions within an electrically conductive layer to isolate separate portions of the conductive layer such that the layer can be used for different functions, e.g., as both power and ground elements, within a product (e.g., electrical assembly) which includes the substrate as part thereof. A method of making the substrate, an electrical assembly utilizing the substrate, a multilayered circuitized assembly also utilizing the substrate and an information handling system, e.g., a mainframe computer, are also provided.
