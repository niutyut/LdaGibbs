title: Electrical switch device with lateral activation

abstract: 
A casing (); a first conductive track () and a second conductive track (); a first conductive dome () which is resiliently deformable so as to be able to pass to a configuration, in which it forms an electrical contact between the first track () and second track (); and an activation device comprising an operation element () which is mounted in the casing so as to slide in an orthogonal manner (X) relative to the axis of deformation (Z). It further comprises: a third conductive track (); and a second conductive dome () which is superimposed on the first () and which is resiliently deformable so as to be able to pass, under the action of an activation pressure, successively from a rest configuration, in which it is in electrical contact only with the third track (), to a configuration of partial deformation, in which it forms an electrical contact with the first dome (), and to a configuration of maximum deformation which corresponds to the configuration of maximum deformation of the first dome (). Use in a release device for a camera.
