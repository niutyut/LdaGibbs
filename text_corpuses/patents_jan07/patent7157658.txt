title: Method and apparatus for fabricating dry cell batteries

abstract: 
A method and apparatus is disclosed for fabricating a dry cell storage battery from a plurality of dry cells by soldering a battery strap to terminals of adjacent dry cells in a battery pack. A resistance heat solder apparatus is provided for soldering a joint defined by an end portion of a battery strap and a terminal of a dry cell, so that adjacent dry cells in the battery pack are in physical and electrical contact. Terminal probes, connected across the secondary coil of a step-down transformer, are used to make contact with the joint to be soldered for applying a voltage across the joint. Terminal probes have contoured tips. A preferred embodiment provides terminal probes which are contoured to be a mirror image of the contour of the joint where the particular terminal probe makes contact with the solder joint. Application of a voltage across the joint provides a collimated current flow path through the joint. An intense heat is created within the joint by the current flow.
