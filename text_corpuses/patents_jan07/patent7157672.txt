title: Method of manufacturing stainless steel pipe for use in piping systems

abstract: 
A welded low carbon dual phase (ferrite plus martensite) and/or low carbon martensitic stainless steel PIPE having requisite yield strength and corrosion and/or erosion resistance is shown. Pipe can be manufactured up to a maximum outside diameter from finished plate or coil by utilizing a high speed-forming mill rather than using the traditional costly seamless pierced billet methods, or utilizing U-O-E or break press. An ERW technique is also used rather than utilizing the traditional laser, tungsten inert gas, gas metal arc, plasma arc, submerged arc or double submerged arc welding methods; or the parameters and procedures for ERW traditionally used to weld carbon steel pipe. Welded pipe dimensions and mechanical properties can be achieved which comply with the heat treatment process and the continuous roll forming mill's capability to produce the yield strengths and dimensional tolerances required to meet the service criteria of the pipe's intended application.
