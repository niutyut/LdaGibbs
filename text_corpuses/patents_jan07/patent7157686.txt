title: Optical receiver

abstract: 
An optical receiver is provided to receive light signals in a specific frequency range and transform into an electric current. The optical receiver has a photo diode with a sensitization area coated with an anti-reflection film and a filter film. The filter film allows a light of a specific frequency range to go through. In comparison with a filter lens used in prior arts, the optical receiver using the filter film has a comparatively smaller volume.
