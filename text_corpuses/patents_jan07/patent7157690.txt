title: Imaging device with triangular photodetector array for use in imaging

abstract: 
An imaging device includes at least three color filters, including first to third color filters having respectively different filtering characteristics; at least three lens systems, including first to third lens systems respectively associated with the first to third color filters; and a photodetection section. The photodetection section includes a first photodetector for receiving light transmitted through the first color filter and the first lens system, a second photodetector for receiving light transmitted through the second color filter and the second lens system, and a third photodetector for receiving light transmitted through the third color filter and the third lens system. Each of the first to third photodetectors has a two-dimensional array of photodetection cells such that centers of the photodetection cells are positioned at apices of triangles sharing respective sides with one another, where none of three corner angles of each triangle is equal to 90?.
