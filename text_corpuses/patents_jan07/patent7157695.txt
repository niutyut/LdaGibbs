title: Optical deflection device including an optical deflection surface having controllable attitude and control method thereof

abstract: 
An optical deflection device has a movable mirror including a mirror portion to deflect a light beam, a driver, which drives the movable mirror, a control circuit, which generates a control signal to control the driver, a light intensity detector, which outputs a light intensity signal corresponding to light intensity of the light beam deflected by the movable mirror, a light intensity monitor circuit, which monitors a change with time of the light intensity signal output to output information on the change as a light intensity monitor signal, and a control signal monitor circuit, which monitors a change with time of the control signal to output information on the change as a control signal monitor signal. The control circuit generates the control signal to increase the output signal from the light intensity detector based on the light intensity monitor signal and control signal monitor signal.
