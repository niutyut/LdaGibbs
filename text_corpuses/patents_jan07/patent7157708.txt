title: Ultra sensitive silicon sensor readout circuitry

abstract: 
A readout circuit for a bolometer type sensor including a pair of back-to-back temperature sensing diodes connected in an electro-thermal feedback loop including a semiconductor amplifier circuit located in an intermediate stage between a detector stage and a heat bath stage and wherein the heat generated by the amplifier equalizes the temperature between the intermediate stage and the detector stage. The readout circuitry also includes circuitry for removing local threshold voltage variations and low frequency 1/f noise components in the readout signal while providing high temperature sensitivity and relatively high voltage gain.
