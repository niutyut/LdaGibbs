title: Method and system for noise control in semiconductor spectroscopy system

abstract: 
An optical power control system for a semiconductor source spectroscopy system controls power fluctuations in the tunable signal from the spectroscopy system and thus improves the noise performance of the system. This general solution has advantages relative to other systems that simply detect reference power levels during the scan and then correct the detected signal after interaction with the sample by reducing the requirements for coordinating the operation of the sample detectors and power or reference detectors. The spectroscopy system comprises a semiconductor source and a tunable filter. The combination of the semiconductor source and tunable signal illuminate a sample with a tunable signal, being tunable over a scan band. The power control system comprises an amplitude detector system for detecting the power of the tunable optical signal and power control system for regulating the amplitude of the tunable optical signal in response to its detected power.
