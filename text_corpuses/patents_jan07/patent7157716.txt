title: Semiconductor radiation detector and radiation detection apparatus

abstract: 
The present invention provides a semiconductor radiation detector and radiation detection apparatus capable of improving energy resolution and the semiconductor radiation detection apparatus includes a semiconductor radiation detector and a signal processing circuit which processes a radiation detection signal output from the semiconductor radiation detector. The semiconductor radiation detector is provided with anode electrodes A and cathode electrodes C disposed so as to face each other with semiconductor radiation detection elements placed in-between. The semiconductor radiation detection element is made up of a single crystal of thallous bromide containing trivalent thallium (e.g., tribromobis thallium). The semiconductor radiation detector containing such a semiconductor radiation detection element reduces lattice defects in the single crystal and thereby increases charge collection efficiency.
