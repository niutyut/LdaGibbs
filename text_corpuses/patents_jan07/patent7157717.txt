title: Optical emission spectroscopy of plasma treated bonding surfaces

abstract: 
A method and system are provided for real-time contaminant detection and plasma treatment verification during plasma treatment of bonding surfaces. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) is utilized to determine contamination of a bonding surface prior to the bonding process. OES is further utilized to monitor bonding sites on the bonding surface to verify effectiveness of the plasma treatment.
