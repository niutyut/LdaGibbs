title: Optical detector able to sense the presence of a container and content therein, and container and printer using the same

abstract: 
A content detecting apparatus uses a signal from a light-receiving part receiving light projected from a light emitting part to detect ink in an ink cartridge. The light-emitting part and the light-receiving part are arranged with differing optical axes. The ink cartridge has reflecting parts for reflecting projected light from the light-emitting part so the projected light reaches the light-receiving part when remaining content is present when the ink cartridge is properly set and with an inclined interface located in a path along which projected light from the light-emitting part reaches the light-receiving part, for switching between permeation and reflection according to the presence and/or absence of remaining content. The inclined interface is permeated along the path with projected light form the light-emitting part when remaining content is present and reflects projected light from the light-emitting part out of the path when remaining content is absent.
