title: Electro-optical device and electronic apparatus

abstract: 
To provide an electro-optical device and an electronic apparatus that have less parasitic capacitance between wiring lines resulted from the crossing wiring lines and operates at a high speed. The electro-optical device includes a first main signal wiring line which is arranged to correspond to a unit circuit and which transmits a predetermined signal; a first sub signal wiring line whose width is narrower than that of the first main signal wiring line; a second main signal wiring line arranged between the first main signal wiring line and the first sub signal wiring line; a first connection wiring line which is connected to the first main signal wiring line and the first sub signal wiring line and which is bridged over the second main signal wiring line; and an internal circuit having a plurality of elements connected to the first sub signal wiring line. The predetermined signal is branched from the first main signal wiring line and is supplied to the internal circuit through the first sub signal wiring line.
