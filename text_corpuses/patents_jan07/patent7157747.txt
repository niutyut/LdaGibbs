title: Bidirectional photothyristor chip, light-fired coupler and solid state relay

abstract: 
A channel isolation region  is formed over the entire width of an N-type silicon substrate , and photothyristors, in each of which an anode diffusion region , a P-gate diffusion region , a cathode diffusion region  are formed parallel to the channel isolation region  over almost the entire width of the N-type silicon substrate , are formed in a left-hand portion and in a right-hand portion and are wired inversely parallel. Thus, the inter-channel movement of residual holes during commutation is restrained by the channel isolation region , by which commutation failure is suppressed to improve a commutation characteristic. Further, an operating current large enough for controlling a load current of approx. 0.2 A is obtained although a chip is divided by the channel isolation region . Therefore, using this bidirectional photothyristor chip makes it possible to implement an inexpensive SSR with a main thyristor eliminated.
