title: Nitride-based semiconductor device

abstract: 
A nitride-based semiconductor device includes a first semiconductor layer consisting essentially of a nitride-based semiconductor, and a second semiconductor layer disposed on the first semiconductor layer and consisting essentially of a non-doped or first conductivity type nitride-based semiconductor. The first and second semiconductor layers forms a hetero-interface. A gate electrode is disposed on the second semiconductor layer. First and second trenches are formed in a surface of the second semiconductor layer at positions sandwiching the gate electrode. Third and fourth semiconductor layers of the first conductivity type are respectively formed in surfaces of the first and second trenches and each consist essentially of a diffusion layer having a resistivity lower than the first and second semiconductor layers. Source and drain electrodes are electrically connected to the third and fourth semiconductor layers, respectively.
