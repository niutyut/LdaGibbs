title: Solid-state imaging device

abstract: 
A solid-state imaging device comprises: photoelectric converting regions, wherein each of the photoelectric converting regions includes first photoelectric converting regions and second photoelectric converting regions arranged in row and column directions; and microlenses each of which being formed above and covering each of the first photoelectric converting regions, wherein each of the second photoelectric converting regions is placed between ones of the microlenses covering adjacent ones of the first photoelectric converting regions, a length in a first direction with respect to an opening center of each of the second photoelectric converting regions is longer than a length in a second direction with respect to the same, and among directions of incidence in a plan view of light entering the second photoelectric converting regions, the microlenses blocks the light along the first direction by a highest degree and blocks the light along the second direction by a lowest degree, respectively.
