title: Magnetic memory device and method of manufacturing magnetic memory device

abstract: 
The present invention provides a magnetic memory device capable of stably writing information by efficiently using a magnetic field generated by current flowing in a conductor, which can be manufactured more easily, and a method of manufacturing the magnetic memory device. The method includes: a stacked body forming step of forming a pair of stacked bodies Sand Son a substrate  a lower yoke forming step of forming a lower yoke B so as to cover at least the pair of stacked bodies Sand Sand a write line forming step of simultaneously forming a pair of first parts F and write bit lines and so as to be disposed adjacent to each other in a first level L via an insulating film A as a first insulating film on the lower yoke B. Thus, the manufacturing process can be more simplified.
