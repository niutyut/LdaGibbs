title: Semiconductor device including insulated gate type transistor with pocket regions and insulated gate type capacitor with no region of reverse conductivity type

abstract: 
It is an object to obtain a semiconductor device having such a structure that respective electrical characteristics of an insulated gate type transistor and an insulated gate type capacitance are not deteriorated and a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device. An NMOS transistor Q and a PMOS transistor Q which are formed in an NMOS formation region A and a PMOS formation region A respectively have P pocket regions  and N pocket regions  in vicinal regions of extension portions and of N source-drain regions  and P source-drain regions , respectively. On the other hand, an N-type variable capacitance C and a P-type variable capacitance C which are formed in an N-type variable capacitance formation region A and a P-type variable capacitance formation region A respectively do not have a region of a reverse conductivity type which is adjacent to extraction electrode regions corresponding to the P pocket regions  and the N pocket regions
