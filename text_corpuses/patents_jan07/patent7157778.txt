title: Semiconductor constructions

abstract: 
The invention encompasses a method of forming an oxide region over a semiconductor substrate. A nitrogen-containing layer is formed across at least some of the substrate. After the nitrogen-containing layer is formed, an oxide region is grown from at least some of the substrate. The nitrogen of the nitrogen-containing layer is dispersed within the oxide region. The invention also encompasses a method of forming a pair of transistors associated with a semiconductor substrate. A substrate is provided. A first region of the substrate is defined, and additionally a second region of the substrate is defined. A first oxide region is formed which covers at least some of the first region of the substrate, and which does not cover any of the second region of the substrate. A nitrogen-comprising layer is formed across at least some of the first oxide region and across at least some of the second region of the substrate. After the nitrogen-comprising layer is formed, a second oxide region is grown from the second region of the substrate. A first transistor gate is formed over the first oxide region, and a second transistor gate is formed over the second oxide region.
