title: Semiconductor device and method for producing the same

abstract: 
A gate electrode is formed on a substrate via a gate insulating film. The gate insulating film includes a high dielectric constant film containing a metal, oxygen and hydrogen, and a lower barrier film formed below the high dielectric constant film and containing a metal, oxygen, silicon and nitrogen.
