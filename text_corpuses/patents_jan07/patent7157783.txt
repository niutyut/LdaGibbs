title: Platinum stuffed with silicon oxide as a diffusion oxygen barrier for semiconductor devices

abstract: 
The present invention provides techniques to fabricate high dielectric MIM storage cell capacitors. In one embodiment, this is accomplished by forming a silicon contact is then formed to electrically connect the formed bottom electrode layer in the container with the at least one associated transistor device. A titanium nitride barrier layer is then formed over the silicon contact. An oxygen barrier layer including platinum stuffed with silicon oxide is then formed over the titanium nitride layer and below the bottom electrode layer. A bottom electrode layer is then formed using platinum over interior surfaces of a container formed relative to at lest one associated transistor device on a silicon substrate. Further, a high dielectric insulator layer is formed over the bottom electrode layer. A top electrode layer is then formed over the high dielectric insulator layer.
