title: Semiconductor device and method for manufacturing the same

abstract: 
An example of a semiconductor device of the present invention includes a first semiconductor element including a first element body portion and a first element electrode that is provided on a first face of the first element body portion; a wiring board including an insulating substrate and a first wiring layer that is formed on one principal face of the insulating substrate, the wiring board being disposed such that the one principal face of the wiring board is opposed to a second face of the first element body portion; a first film that covers at least a portion of a face of the first semiconductor element that includes the surface of the first element electrode and at least a portion of a face on the first semiconductor element side of the wiring board; and a second wiring layer that is formed on a face on the wiring board side of the first film and that includes a first conductor having first and second ends. The first end of the first conductor is bonded to the first element electrode, and the second end of the first conductor is bonded to a portion of the first wiring layer.
