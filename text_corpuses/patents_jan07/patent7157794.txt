title: Semiconductor device that suppresses variations in high frequency characteristics of circuit elements

abstract: 
A semiconductor device includes a semiconductor substrate having a main surface, the main surface including a first area formed with a high-frequency circuit element and a second area located around the first area and formed with a low-frequency circuit element. The semiconductor device also includes a sealing resin which covers the main surface; a plurality of first external terminals which are formed above the second area and which are electrically connected to the high-frequency circuit element, the first external terminals protruding from the surface of the sealing resin. The semiconductor device further includes a plurality of second external terminals which are formed above the second area and which are electrically connected to the low-frequency circuit element, the second external terminals protruding from the surface of the sealing resin.
