title: System and method for controlling and distributing electrical energy in a vehicle

abstract: 
This invention discloses a load and battery control device for controlling and distributing electrical energy in a vehicle electrical system comprising a generator, an electrical load, and a stored energy source. The device monitors and processes electrical signals generated by the vehicle electrical system and compares them to a vehicle operating state. The device operates on a switching system to controllably connect or disconnect the generator, electrical load, or stored energy source, or any combination thereof, with the vehicle electrical system to be consistent with a pre-determined vehicle operating configuration.
