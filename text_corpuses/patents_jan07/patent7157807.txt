title: Three phase rectifier circuit with virtual neutral

abstract: 
A rectifier circuit powers three power conversion modules using a three phase AC input without a neutral connection. The rectifier circuit includes a first bridge rectifier that is connected to a first phase of the three phase AC input and that produces a first rectified waveform. A second bridge rectifier is connected to a second phase of the three phase AC input and produces a second rectified waveform. A third bridge rectifier is connected to a third phase of the three phase AC input and produces a third rectified waveform. A first inductor has one end that is connected to the first bridge rectifier. A second inductor has one end that is connected to the second bridge rectifier. A third inductor has one end that is connected to the third bridge rectifier. Opposite ends of the first, second and third inductors are connected to form a virtual neutral. A protection circuit prevents overvoltage when one of the DC outputs is shorted.
