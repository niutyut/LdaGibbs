title: Axial fan motor with a laminated casing

abstract: 
Disclosed is an axial fan motor for air-cooling a heat sink of a heating element and thermally connected to the heat sink. The casing of the axial fan motor is formed of a plurality of laminated metal plates. The plurality of metal plates include a single first metal plate and a plurality of second metal plates. The single first metal plate, which is an outermost layer located at the air exhaust side of the fan, has a peripheral portion, a central portion, and a plurality of arm portions for connecting the peripheral portion and the central portion. A bearing holder for supporting a rotary shaft of the fan is attached to the central portion. Each of the plurality of second metal plates is selected from a first-type second metal plate having a peripheral portion only, a second-type second metal plate having a peripheral portion only and assuming an outline of greater size than the outline of the first-type second metal plate, and a third-type second metal plate having a peripheral portion only, having a single cutout portion formed in the peripheral portion, and assuming an outline substantially equal in size to that of the first-type second metal plate.
