title: Near-resonance wide-range operating electromechanical motor

abstract: 
The present invention combines bending mode mechanical (f) and electrical (f) resonances, whereby a relatively good efficiency can be achieved within a relatively broad frequency range (?f). An electrical resonance (f) or mechanical resonance is designed to be situated in the same order of magnitude as another mechanical resonance (f), but separated therefrom. Preferably, the separation (?f) is smaller than 2f/Q, where fis the resonance frequency for the resonance having lowest quality value, and Qis the corresponding quality value of the mechanical resonance. An electromechanical motor comprising a driving element and electrical resonance circuit according to the above ideas may comprise a double bimorph driving element having one single actuating point influencing a body to be moved. The double bimorph driving element is excited in bending vibrations perpendicular to a main displacement direction, whereby both tangential and perpendicular motions are created by bending mode vibrations.
