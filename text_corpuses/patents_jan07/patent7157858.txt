title: Self light emitting display module, electronic equipment into which the same module is loaded, and inspection method of defect state in the same module

abstract: 
In a detection mode, a reverse bias voltage VM is applied to any one of scan lines K?Km arranged in a light emitting display panel . The electrical potentials generated at respective data lines A?An of this time are supplied to potential determination means J?Jn. In the potential determination means J?Jn, the electrical potentials generated at the respective data lines A?An are supplied to switching elements Q?Qvia transfer switches Q?Q. When the electrical potentials are the threshold voltages of the switching elements Q?Qor greater, the outputs of comparators CP?CPn are inverted, and the states of this time are latched in latch circuits LC?LCn to be stored in a data register . By data stored in the data register , it is determined whether or not a defect has occurred in pixels of the display panel, and the location thereof is also determined.
