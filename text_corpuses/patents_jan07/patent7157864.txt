title: Vehicular lamp, cold cathode fluorescent lamp lighting apparatus, and cold cathode fluorescent lamp lighting method

abstract: 
There is provided a vehicular lamp that can prevent excess current from flowing between an anode and a cathode at the lighting-up start to prevent a damage and life shortening of a cold cathode fluorescent lamp at low cost. The vehicular lamp includes: a cold cathode fluorescent lamp having a cathode, a gate, and an anode; and a lighting controlling unit operable to pre-discharge electricity from the cathode to the gate prior to lighting of the cold cathode fluorescent lamp, in which the lighting controlling unit applies a voltage between the cathode and the anode after once lowering a voltage between the cathode and the gate and then again applies an extraction voltage between the cathode and the gate in order to begin to discharge electricity from the cathode to the anode. The lighting controlling unit may pre-discharge electricity from the cathode to the gate until the temperature of the cathode is substantially equal to that of lighting-up time.
