title: Method and system for battery protection employing a selectively-actuated switch

abstract: 
A system and method for battery protection. In some aspects, a method of conducting an operation including a battery pack, includes the acts of monitoring a first battery pack condition at a first monitoring rate, determining when a second battery pack condition reaches a threshold, after the second battery pack condition reaches the threshold, monitoring the first battery pack condition at a second monitoring rate, the second monitoring rate being different than the first monitoring rate. In some aspects, a method of conducting an operation including a battery, the battery including a cell having a voltage, power being transferable between the cell and the electrical device, a controller operable to control a function of the battery pack, the controller being operable with a voltage at least one of equal to and greater than an operating voltage threshold, the cell being operable to selectively supply voltage to the controller, includes the act of enabling the controller to operate when the voltage supplied by the cell is below the operating voltage threshold.
