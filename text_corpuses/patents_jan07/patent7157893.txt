title: Temperature independent reference voltage generator

abstract: 
There is provided a reference voltage generator that generates a constant reference voltage regardless of a change in temperature. The reference voltage generator includes a temperature-compensated current generating part for reducing a supply current provided to an output terminal in response to an increase of temperature, and a diode for receiving the supply current through the output terminal.
