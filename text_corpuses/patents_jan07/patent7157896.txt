title: Device for locating and identifying circuit breakers

abstract: 
The transmitter of the circuit breaker locator draws large amplitude, short duration, phase locked unipolar pulses of current from the power source at a frequency lower than that of the AC line frequency. The audible and visual indicators of the transmitter are triggered at the rate of the current pulses drawn from the AC line. The receiver of the circuit breaker locator has a pick-up coil that responds to magnetic field surrounding the circuit breaker, an amplifier for boosting the signal from the pick-up coil, and a single shot pulse stretcher triggered by the amplifier. The pulse stretcher drives both audible and visual signals, and at the same time charges a memory capacitor in a staircase generator fashion. The magnitude of the memory capacitor voltage in turn controls the gain of the amplifier. A switch controls the voltage applied to the amplifier, which increases by a predetermined amount when released.
