title: Prioritized interrupt for waveform measurement

abstract: 
An interrupt request is asserted in anticipation of a period of latency preceding preparedness of a power meter data processing device to sample a voltage or current enabling the use an interrupt to control the data processing device's performance of real-time sampling in combination with other tasks related to the power meter's operation.
