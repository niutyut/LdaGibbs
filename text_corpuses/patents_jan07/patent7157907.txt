title: Non-contact rotation angle detecting sensor

abstract: 
A stationary yoke surrounds an outer peripheral surface of a ring-shaped permanent magnet in a certain distance. The ring-shaped permanent magnet is fixed to a rotor and has two poles of N, S poles in a diameter direction. The stationary yoke includes a first outside yoke and a second outside yoke overlapped in an axial direction and a hole element is disposed in a gap of the first outside yoke. An axial height of the first outside yoke changes along the circumferential direction and a height of the second outside yoke has a complementary relation with the height of the first outside yoke, and the first outside yoke and the second outside yoke are overlapped in a certain clearance. A ratio of an amount of the magnetic flux passing through the gap to an amount of the magnetic flux not passing through the gap changes with rotation of the ring-shaped permanent magnet and further, the change of the height causes a change in the magnetic flux amount flowing in the first outside yoke, thereby improving linearity of an output of a hole element.
