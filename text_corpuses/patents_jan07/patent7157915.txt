title: Combined characterization and inversion of reservoir parameters from nuclear, NMR and resistivity measurements

abstract: 
A method of determining the distribution of shales, sands and water in a reservoir including laminated shaly sands using vertical and horizontal conductivities derived from nuclear, NMR, and multi-component induction data such as from a Multicomponent Induction Logging Tool
