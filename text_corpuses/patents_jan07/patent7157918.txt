title: Method and system for calibrating a measurement device path and for measuring a device under test in the calibrated measurement device path

abstract: 
A method and system of calibrating first and second adapters comprises the steps of calibrating coaxial ports of a vector network analyzer to traceable standards and connecting a symmetrical through circuit path between the coaxial ports. The through circuit path comprises a cascaded combination of the first and second adapters. The first adapter is passive and substantially identical to the second adapter and uncascaded first and second adapters comprise a measurement device path. The through circuit path and the measurement device path have substantially equivalent S-parameters. S-parameters of the through circuit path are measured and then the first and second adapters are characterized based upon the measured S-parameters. The method and system may be applied to two port adapters and devices under test and may also be scaled for multi-port adapters and devices under test.
