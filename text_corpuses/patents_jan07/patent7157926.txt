title: Universal padset concept for high-frequency probing

abstract: 
A universal, substrate Padset for de-embedding pad and signal line parasitics has an input pad group including a first input signal pad and a first ground pad; an output pad group including a first output signal pad and a second ground pad; a first input-signal-routing network for routing the first input signal pad to a first input node of a first predetermined test device; a first output-signal-routing network for routing the first output signal pad to a first output node of the first predetermined test device; a second input-signal-routing network for routing the first input signal pad to a second input node of a second predetermined test device; and a second output-signal-routing network for routing the first output signal pad to a second output node of the second predetermined test device. The layout configuration of the first test device is different from the layout configuration of the second test device.
