title: Termination circuits having pull-down and pull-up circuits and related methods

abstract: 
A termination circuit for a transmission line may include an input node, a pull-down circuit, and a pull-up circuit. The input node receives an input signal over the transmission line. The pull-down circuit is coupled between the input node and a first reference voltage, and the pull-down circuit may be configured to provide an electrical path between the first reference voltage and the input node responsive to the input signal having a first voltage level. The pull-up circuit is coupled between the input node and a second reference voltage, and the pull-up circuit is configured to provide an electrical path between the second reference voltage and the input node responsive to the input signal having a second voltage level. More particularly, the first reference voltage is less than the second reference voltage, and the first voltage level is greater than the second voltage level. Related methods are also discussed.
