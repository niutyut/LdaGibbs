title: Frequency selection of switch mode power converters via softstart voltage level

abstract: 
A switch mode power converter that limits the in-rush current at start-up and reduces the occurrence of output voltage overshoot over a range of switching frequencies. The converter includes at least one Soft-Start (SS)/Frequency-Select(FS) input, at least one oscillator enable input, and an oscillator having at least one control input. Soft-start programming is linked to the frequency selection of the converter. An external capacitor connected between the SS/FS input and ground is employed to program the soft-start time, and the switching frequency generated by the oscillator is selected via the state of the SS/FS input.
