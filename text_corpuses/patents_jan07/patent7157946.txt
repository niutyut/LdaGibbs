title: Chopper comparator circuit

abstract: 
The conventional chopper comparator circuit has had high power consumption because the gain thereof used to be set high, so that there has been the need for cutting down on power consumption. In view of the problem described, there is provided a chopper comparator circuit having input terminals , capacitors C, C, switches SW, SW, SW, SW, one to a plurality of inverter circuitries disposed behind the capacitors C, C, respectively, and an output terminal; the respective comprise one to a plurality of gated inverters , each comprising a first logic circuit transistor of a first conductivity type, a second logic circuit transistor of a second conductivity type, a first current control transistor of the first conductivity type, and a second current control transistor of the second conductivity type, wherein the first logic circuit transistor and the second logic circuit transistor are connected in series, the first logic circuit transistor has a main electrode connected to a first power supply line via the first current control transistor, and the second logic circuit transistor has a main electrode connected to a second power supply line via the second current control transistor.
