title: Delay locked loop capable of preventing false lock and method thereof

abstract: 
A DLL capable of preventing false lock includes a false-lock detector, a delay line coupled for using at least one delay lag of the delay line to delay an incoming clock signal and produce at least one delay clock, and a charge pump coupled to the false-lock detector for adjusting a control voltage according to an upward or downward adjustment signal. The false-lock detector includes a first phase detector coupled to a first clock signal and a second clock signal for comparing phases of the first clock signal and the second clock signal to produce a phase difference signal; an average circuit coupled to the first phase detector for generating an average signal corresponding to an average of the phase difference signal; and a comparator circuit coupled to the average circuit for comparing the average signal with at least one reference signal to produce the upward or downward adjustment signal.
