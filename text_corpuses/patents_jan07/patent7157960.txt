title: Apparatus and method for stabilizing a boosted voltage, apparatus and method for generating a boosted voltage having the same

abstract: 
An apparatus for stabilizing a boosted voltage includes a voltage detector, a buffer driver control unit and a buffer driver. The voltage detector detects a change in a level of a boosted voltage and outputs first through N-th detection signals corresponding to the detected change, the boosted voltage being generated to have a higher voltage level than a power supply voltage level in response to a clock signal. The buffer driver control unit generates first through 2N-th current control signals based on the first through N-th detection signals. The buffer driver includes first through N-th inverter drivers that selectively operate based on the first through 2N-th current control signals, thereby modulating a charging current for generating the boosted voltage. Hence, the boosted voltage having a constant level and a reduced ripple may be generated.
