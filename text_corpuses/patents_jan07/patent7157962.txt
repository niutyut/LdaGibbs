title: Charge pump output device with leakage cancellation

abstract: 
The charge pump circuit includes: a charge pump output branch; a current leakage device coupled to the output branch; and a feedback device coupled between the output branch and a control node of the current leakage device such that the leakage device cancels leakage current from the output branch.
