title: System and method for control of loop alignment in adaptive feed forward amplifiers

abstract: 
A fast search algorithm for loop alignment of a feed forward amplifier is disclosed. The algorithm controls a processor that adjusts, digitally, the gain and phase of the loop alignment based on power measurements at the input and output of cancellation combiners, to find the optimal setting. A ?non-collinear descent? algorithm is used to search, iteratively, for the minimum within an error surface. For loop alignment, the error surface is defined by the set of measurement points comprising the alignment settings and the associated cancellation residuals. For the case of first loop alignment, the cancellation residual is measured using the ratio of two power detectors located at the input and after the cancellation (error) combiner. For second loop alignment, cancellation is estimated using the residual pilot power detected at the output of the amplifier. The preferred alignment method uses three successive measurements to estimate the gradient direction with respect to gain and phase shifter settings. The actual descent direction is selected to be close to the gradient direction without being collinear with the most recent alignment adjustments. Quantization of the descent direction simplifies the implementation as well as the enforcement of the non-collinearity constraint on successive alignment settings. Two different step size selection approaches are disclosed, however, any standard step size selection approach may be employed.
