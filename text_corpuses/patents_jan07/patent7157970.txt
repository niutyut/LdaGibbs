title: Rail-to-rail-input buffer

abstract: 
A rail-to-rail-Input Buffer with constant mutual conductance includes a differential input; a first differential stage supplied with a first reference current; a second differential stage supplied with a second reference current; a switching PMOS-transistor which switches through when the input signal is higher than a first threshold voltage to divert the first reference current to a first current mirror circuit; a switching NMOS-transistor which switches through when an input signal is lower than a second threshold voltage to divert the second reference current to a second current mirror circuit; a third differential stage supplied with the mirrored first reference current and replaces the first differential stage when the input signal is higher than the first threshold voltage; and a fourth differential stage supplied with the mirrored second reference current and replaces the second differential stage when the input signal is lower than the second threshold voltage.
