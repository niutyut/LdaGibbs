title: High frequency amplifier

abstract: 
A high frequency amplifier comprising a first trans-impedance amplifier, a second trans-impedance amplifier, a third amplifier, and a variant current source is provided. The first trans-impedance amplifier receives an input current and outputs a first output voltage accordingly. The second trans-impedance outputs a second voltage. The third amplifier receives the first and the second voltage. The variant current source is connected between the input terminal of the second trans-impedance and a ground terminal or a power supply source. The variant current source delivers a variant current to change the second voltage such that the second voltage may follow the first voltage. The input current flows into the first trans-impedance amplifier, while the variant current flows into the second trans-impedance amplifier. The input current flows out the first trans-impedance amplifier, while the variant current flows out the second trans-impedance amplifier.
