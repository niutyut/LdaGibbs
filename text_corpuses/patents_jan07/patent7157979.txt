title: Phase-lock loops

abstract: 
A phase lock loop comprises a variable frequency oscillator (), a divider (), a phase comparator (), a gain control stage (), and a loop filter (). The frequency response of the loop is measured by superimposing a modulation at a number of different rates on the error signal generated by the phase comparator, and by measuring for each modulation rate the peak-to-peak variation of the loop control signal controlling the oscillator frequency. If, due to errors in component values, the frequency response deviates from its desired value, the loop gain is adjusted to bring the frequency response close to its desired value.
