title: Electromagnetic switching device

abstract: 
In the electromagnetic switching device, it is possible to miniaturize and have low costs, have quiet operation noise, and also quickly extinguish the arc. The electromagnetic switching device has an electromagnetic actuator with a movable iron core, a pair of fixed terminals that respectively have a fixed contact point, a movable contact that has movable contact points on the right and left ends, a shaft, and an enclosing component that holds the movable contact points and the fixed contact points. The pair of movable contact points respectively contact with and detach from the pair of fixed contact points, and the pair of fixed contact points respectively conduct each other and are insulated again through the shaft by moving the movable iron core along the axis using the electric magnetic actuator. A quasi-hermetically sealed space, which is the extinguishing space, is formed by the enclosing component and a first yoke. A potting compound is charged, into the space between a body and the quasi hermitically sealed space.
