title: Magnet structure for nuclear magnetic resonance imaging apparatus

abstract: 
A magnet structure for a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance imaging apparatus includes at least two opposing magnetic pole pieces, which are located at a certain distance from each other and delimit an imaging region. The pole pieces are formed by at least one massive layer of a magnetically permeable material, and at least one layer of magnetically permeable material having a pack of superimposed sheets or foils, electrically insulated from each other. Each of the sheets has cuts arranged over the surface of the sheet in positions that are at least partly non coincident with the cuts of at least one, or both adjacent sheets. The magnetically permeable sheets or foils have a first face and a second face and the cuts are so arranged on each sheet that the cuts of a sheet or foil are offset and not coincident with respect to the cuts of an adjacent sheet or foil, when said adjacent sheet is laid over the previous sheet in an overturned position, i.e. with the first face turned toward the first face of the first sheet or with the second face of said adjacent sheet turned toward the second face of the first sheet.
