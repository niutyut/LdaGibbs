title: Detection of broadcast signals for defining useable frequency bands for powerline communication

abstract: 
The present invention refers to a method for defining useable frequency bands for a powerline communication (PLC) system () using power supply lines of a power supply network () for interconnecting a number of PLC nodes () such that electromagnetic emissions generated by PLC signals (s(t)) transmitted via said power supply lines do not interfere with broadcast RF signals radiated in the same frequency bands. Before starting own communication activities, PLC nodes () participating in a PLC session scan (S) the entire frequency range designated for powerline communication to detect (S) frequency bands which are occupied by broadcast services. During powerline communication the occurrence of broadcast signals is regularly checked (S) by screening (S) the entire frequency range designated for powerline communication and detecting (S) relevant broadcast bands that should be omitted during powerline communication to avoid interference noise (n(t)). After that, new frequency bands for powerline communication are allocated (S) within said frequency range, provided that these new bands are not occupied by any detected wireless service.
