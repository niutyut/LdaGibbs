title: Automated diagnoses and prediction in a physical security surveillance system

abstract: 
An invention that automatically reports and collects security surveillance problems, device diagnostics and device state information from cameras and security detection equipment. Devices may be attached to a network or attached through a device controller on a network but are not limited to that topology. Each detected occurrence is recorded for analysis and reporting to network administration centers. The device or the controller may also keep track of trend information and report that over time. The administration center produces warning alerts and notifications. These alerts and notifications may not be related to a single problem or intrusion but may be based on trend, predictive or diagnostic information using predictive algorithms. Special charts, graphs, histogram and other reports are produced by the system to aid in proactive diagnosis, problem prediction and behavior patterns. The system produces predictive information based on trend and periodic information to alert operators of potential upcoming problems and behavior.
