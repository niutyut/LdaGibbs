title: Intelligent multi purpose early warning system for shipping containers, components therefor and methods of making the same

abstract: 
A multipurpose sensing system of detecting, qualifying and quantifying a potential threat to national security comprises a multipurpose sensing module associated with each cargo carrying container. The system tracks the instantaneous location of each cargo carrying container with the multipurpose sensing module on board each cargo carrying container sampling the contents thereof for the presence of material selected from the group comprising nuclear, biological and chemical grade weapons material. The multipurpose sensing module has an external signaling device associated therewith, the external signaling device disposed remote from the multipurpose sensing module and externally of the cargo carrying container wherein the external signaling device is lighted when the multipurpose sensing module senses the presence of the material and wherein the external signaling device remaining activated until corrective action has been taken to neutralize the material and return the cargo carrying container to a safe state.
