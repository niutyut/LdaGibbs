title: Monitoring system and method

abstract: 
Sensing devices for sensing a person  moving close to a plurality of previously selected locations and receivers for receiving identification data transmitted from an identification tag  co-operate to acquire behavior data indicative of the movement pattern of a person , and a processing device  compares the behavior data to reference data relating to an authorized person previously identified by the identification data, in order to determine whether or not the result of the comparison indicates the existence of a difference. Then, when the processing device determines that the result of the comparison does not indicate the existence of a difference, it does not transmit the image data acquired via cameras disposed in predetermined locations to a delivery system . In contrast, when the processing device determines that the result of the comparison indicates the existence of a difference, the processing device outputs the image data to the delivery system  which in turn delivers the data to a supervisor.
