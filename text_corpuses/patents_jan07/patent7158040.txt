title: Environmental condition detector with audible alarm and voice identifier

abstract: 
Due to the presence of various environmental condition detectors in the home and businesses such as smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, natural gas detectors, etc., each having individual but similar sounding alarm patterns, it can be difficult for occupants of such dwellings to immediately determine the specific type of environmental condition that exists during an alarm condition. The present invention comprises an environmental condition detector using both tonal pattern alarms and pre-recorded voice messages to indicate information about the environmental condition being sensed. Single-station battery-powered and 120VAC detectors are described as are multiple-station interconnected 120 VAC powered detectors. The pre-recorded voice messages describe the type of environmental condition detected or the location of the environmental condition detector sensing the condition, or both, in addition to the tonal pattern alarm. Provisions are made for multi-lingual pre-recorded voice messages.
