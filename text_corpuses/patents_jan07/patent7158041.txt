title: Electrical protection device and method for a communication circuit

abstract: 
A protection device for a communication circuit that includes a sensor monitoring a protection device parameter and an indication module coupled to the sensor. The indication module generates an indication output as a function of the protection device parameter indicating a protection device event. The indication module receives power from an indication power source separate from the telecommunication signal. Also a method for protecting a telecommunication signal with a protection device including sensing a protection device parameter indicating a protection device event. The method also includes powering an indication module from an indication power source that is separate from the telecommunication signal. The method further includes generating an indication output from the indication module as a function of the protection device parameter indicating the protection device event.
