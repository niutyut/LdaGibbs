title: General purpose input board for a touch actuation

abstract: 
This invention describes a method for a touch actuation in an electronic device using a general purpose input board. The input board comprises of a grating of conductors running in one direction (y-lines). Between these conductors there are contacts connected to a grating running in the perpendicular direction a layer below (x-lines). The grating layers are separated by an insulating layer. The input board can be manufactured using a wide variety of technologies, e.g., printable resistive, conductive and insulating materials. Various known methods can be used to read the position of any conductive actuator touching the input board. The input board can be used as a configurable UI board under a keymat. The input devices on the keymat can be a key, a joystick, a touchpad top membrane, etc. and their configurations and positions can be freely varied on switchcovers. In addition, the actuators can be made force-sensitive by detecting a contact surface area.
