title: Encoding apparatus and method, recording medium and program

abstract: 
A code sequence is encoded using a code conversion table in which the parity of the code sequence varies until the code states become equal to each other. The code word assignment used in this code conversion table is such that the decoded code word constraint length is 3 blocks and q?qfor an arbitrary information sequence is satisfied even if a DC control bit is inserted at any of the first and second bits of an information word. Code states sand swhen information sequences dand dresulted from insertion of provisional DC control bits  and  inserted at the top of an information sequence ?1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0? are encoded starting with a state  according to a predetermined code conversion table are equal to each other, namely, s=s=6, in a third block, and two's complement qof a sum of code sequences cup to a time when the code states are equal to each other is ?0,? while two's complement qof a sum of code sequences cup to that time is ?1?. That is, the condition that q?qis met. The code sequence can be applied to a recorder/player or encoder.
