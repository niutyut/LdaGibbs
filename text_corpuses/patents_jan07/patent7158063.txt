title: High-resolution sigma-delta converter

abstract: 
A sigma-delta converter is disclosed. In one embodiment, the sigma-delta converter includes two series-connected converter stages which are each supplied with a feedback signal, a comparator stage which is connected downstream of the second converter stage, which is supplied with the output signal from the second converter stage and which provides an at least two-value comparator signal, and at least one output stage which has at least one digital integrator and which produces a multibit signal as output signal. The sigma-delta converter also has a first feedback look, which is supplied with the output signal and which has a multibit digital-analog converter which is supplied with the output signal and which converts this output signal into a first feedback signal with an amplitude that is dependent on the output signal, and a second feedback loop, which is supplied with the comparator signal, having a digital-analog converter which converts a signal that is dependent on the comparator signal into the second feedback signal.
