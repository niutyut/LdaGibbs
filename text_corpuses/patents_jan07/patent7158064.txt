title: Continuous-time delta-sigma ADC with programmable input range

abstract: 
A scaled input current is produced that substantially matches the full scale input of a CT??ADC that substantially cancels an offset bias current component of the input current. A variable bias resistance value is coupled between the integrator input and one of a supply voltage and a circuit common. The method further includes integrating the input current to produce an integrated signal representing a time averaged value of the input current to substantially remove noise from a frequency band of interest. The integrated signal is produced to a quantizer to produce a feedback current that substantially cancels a quantization noise component in the digital representation of the scaled analog signal by coupling the digital representation of the scaled analog signal to a programmable digital switch wherein the programmable digital switch either sinks current from or sources current to the integrator input.
