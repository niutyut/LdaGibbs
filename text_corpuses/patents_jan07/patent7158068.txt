title: Technique for comparing analog signal with reference voltage

abstract: 
The present invention provides a technique for reducing power consumption of an A/D converting device. An A/D converting device according to the present invention includes: multiple comparators each of which has a function for comparing input analog signals with a predetermined reference voltage; an A/D converter for converting the input analog signal into the digital signal with a predetermined number of bits using comparison results from the multiple comparators; a determining unit for determining which range the voltage of the input analog signal belongs to before the comparators comparing the input analog signal with the reference voltages; and a control unit for controlling power supply for the multiple comparators corresponding to the range determined by the determining unit. Thus, power is supplied only to the comparators necessary for this particular A/D conversion, thereby reducing power consumption.
