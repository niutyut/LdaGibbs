title: Ethernet connection of airborne radar over fiber optic cable

abstract: 
A weather radar signal path for an aircraft. The signal path has an antenna, a digital down-converter, a first transceiver, fiber optic cabling, a second transceiver and a processing unit. The antenna is adapted to, in a first mode, receive reflected radar signals from atmosphere ahead. The digital down-converter is adapted to convert the reflected radar signals received by the antenna into digital radar signals at a lower frequency. The first transceiver is adapted to, in the first mode, at least transmit the digital radar signals through said fiber optic cabling. The fiber optic cabling is adapted to, in the first mode, transfer the digital radar signals between the first and second transceivers. The second transceiver is adapted to, in the first mode, receive said digital radar signals from the fiber optic cabling. The processing unit is adapted to, in the first mode, process the digital radar signals to generate weather information based on predetermined algorithm.
