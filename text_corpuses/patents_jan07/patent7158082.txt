title: Low-height dual or multi-band antenna, in particular for motor vehicles

abstract: 
The invention relates to an improved, low-height dual or multi-band antenna comprising surface transmitters, whose size varies in accordance with the frequency band to be transmitted. Said antenna is configured from a smaller surface transmitter that is located on top of a larger surface transmitter. The antenna is characterized by the following improved features: the dual or multi-band antenna is essentially configured as a one-piece punched and bent metal part; as a one-piece component, said antenna consists of at least two surface transmitters, which are electrically connected via a short-circuit; and at least the lowest surface transmitter for transmission in a lower frequency band and/or at least a surface transmitter that is lower than the surface transmitter for transmission in the highest frequency band have transmitter wings lying adjacent to their transmitter surface. When the antenna is viewed from above, the respective surface transmitter for transmission in a higher frequency band lies between the wings of said lower frequency band transmitters.
