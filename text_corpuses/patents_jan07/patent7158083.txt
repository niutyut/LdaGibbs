title: Communication terminal

abstract: 
The invention aims at providing a communication terminal capable of suppressing degradation of an antenna gain irrespective of whether the casing of the communication terminal is opened or closed. The communication terminal includes a hinge for coupling in a foldable manner a first casing member and a second casing member, each including conductors such as a first printed board and a second printed board. In close proximity to the hinge in the second casing member is provides a second antenna. The hinge includes a first rotation axis composed of a conductive metal material working as an axis of rotation of two casing members in opposite directions and a second rotation axis composed of a conductive metal material working as an axis of rotation in a direction orthogonal to the direction of rotation about the first rotation axis. A predetermined clearance L to place the conductors of the first and second casing members in capacity coupling is formed and the hinge is insulated from the conductor of one of the two casing members.
