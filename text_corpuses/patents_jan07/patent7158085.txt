title: Antenna apparatus for sliding-type portable terminal

abstract: 
Disclosed is an antenna apparatus for a sliding-type portable terminal having a first housing and a second housing adapted to slide along the longitudinal direction of the first housing including an external antenna having a stationary antenna portion extending along the longitudinal direction and having an end fixed on the first housing and at least one movable antenna portion extending along the longitudinal direction and having the other end fixed to the second housing so that, as the second housing slides, it retracts in and extends out of the stationary antenna portion. The antenna apparatus for a sliding-type portable terminal has an external antenna which, together with the embedded antenna, compensates for the deteriorated performance of the embedded antenna during a speech mode. In addition, the antenna apparatus does not affect the design of the terminal and provides various types of terminal design, because it does not protrudes out of the terminal.
