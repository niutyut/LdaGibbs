title: Magnetic source oscillators universal passive antenna

abstract: 
A device concerning a magnetic source oscillators universal passive antenna to receive or transmit electromagnetic waves from low frequencies to hyper frequencies. The device is made with a special dipolar system that contains two identical parts () and () that are assembled by a metal support (). This metal support () can have a variable and adaptable form. Each identical part () and () of the special dipolar system is made with a triangular magnet (), a triangular special conductor or semiconductor () from which pointed edge is a conducting point () or (). A wave-pick-up-system made with two cables (), (), and a cable entrance (). The acting principle of the antenna formed with the special dipolar system and the wave-pick-up-system, is sealed in a filled insulating material box () and raised on a tripod support () and () that can be very variable and adaptable with the purpose to fix the antenna to function without disturbance. The device of the invention is effective in the frequency range from low frequencies to hyper frequencies and very effective for satellites communication.
