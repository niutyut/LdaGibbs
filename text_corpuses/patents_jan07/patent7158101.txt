title: PDP driving device and method

abstract: 
In a PDP driving circuit, first and second inductors are coupled to a panel capacitor. The driving circuit stores a first energy in the first inductor through a current in the first direction while the voltage at the panel capacitor is maintained to be a first voltage, and uses the first energy and resonance between the panel capacitor and the first inductor to reduce the voltage at the panel capacitor to a second voltage. Next, the driving circuit maintains the voltage at the panel capacitor to be the second voltage, recovers the energy remaining in the first inductor, stores a second energy in a second inductor through a current in the second direction, and uses the energy stored in the second inductor to increase the voltage at the panel capacitor to the first voltage. Therefore, rising and falling time of the voltage at the panel capacitor is shortened, and zero-voltage switching is possible when the driving circuit has a parasitic component.
