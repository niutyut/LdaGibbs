title: Electro-optical device, method of manufacturing the same, and electronic apparatus

abstract: 
The invention enhances, at low cost, the display performance of an electro-optical device to reflect the light emitted from a light-emitting layer to an electrode opposite to a substrate. Within a circuit part, a silicon layer and a condenser electrode formed from a first metal layer thereon, with a gate-insulating layer sandwiched therebetween, is provided under a pixel display part. Further, a second metal layer forms a power source line parallel to a signal line with a width covering the pixel display part and with a thickness having reflexibility. The light emitted and transmitted through an anode from an organic EL layer, is reflected upwardly by the power source line and is emitted from the pixel display part. A storage capacitor is formed in a layer below the power source line by the silicon layer, the condenser electrode, and the power source line. As a result, the space of the circuit part is efficiently used.
