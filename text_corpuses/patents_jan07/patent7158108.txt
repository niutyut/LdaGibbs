title: Column electrode driving circuit and voltage generating circuit for a liquid crystal display

abstract: 
Column electrode driving circuit for a display device which reduces power consumption arid is capable of gray-scale displaying. The driving circuit include a gray-scale voltage producing system including amplifiers whose inputs are applied with a plurality of gray-scale voltages, respectively, and a selecting system for selecting and outputting any of output signals of the amplifiers for each pixel or each predetermined displayed unit in accordance with an image signal indicative of a gray-scale level for the pixel or displayed unit. The gray-scale voltage producing system causes any amplifiers of the amplifiers, which correspond to a predetermined number of predetermined gray scale levels, to be powered off and causing the other amplifiers to be powered on during a predetermined mode, the selecting system select any of output signals of the amplifiers powered on during the predetermined mode. A further construction based on potential divider circuits is also disclosed.
