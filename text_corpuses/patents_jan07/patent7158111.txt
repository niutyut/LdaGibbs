title: Flexible display

abstract: 
A display includes pixels having a magnetically controllable reflectivity. The pixels are formed between a pair of flexible non-conductive sheets. Each of the magnetically controllable pixels includes a flexible ring located between the flexible non-conductive sheets. Each of the magnetically controllable pixels also includes magnetic particles located within the flexible ring. The location of the magnetic particles with respect to the flexible non-conductive sheets determines the reflectivity of the pixel. The display is especially suitable for use in connection with portable electronic devices.
