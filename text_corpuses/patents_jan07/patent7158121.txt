title: Enhanced touch-screen display system

abstract: 
An enhanced touch-screen display system is disclosed for generating pixel coordinate estimates corresponding to a location on a display screen touched by a user. The system is an analog resistive touch-screen display system having a processor and associated software algorithms to allow for the calibration and validation of pixel coordinate estimates as an integral part of the real-time generation of the pixel coordinate estimates. Multiple calibrated pixel coordinate estimates are generated and processed at a pre-defined sampling rate to determine a valid pixel position to minimize sampling delays due to settling times. The x-axis position is also validated before the system attempts to generate a y-axis position to avoid the wasted time for generating y-axis estimates when x-axis estimates are corrupted. Noisy estimates are inherently reduced in the touch-screen display system by providing shunts across certain drivers in the system that also allow for detection of a ?no touch? state.
