title: System and method for drawing and painting with warped bitmap brushes

abstract: 
A system and method is described for rendering a warped brush stroke using a bitmap brush image, the brush stroke being along a arbitrarily curved guideline. The described system and method generate a piecewise linear approximation to the guideline followed by generating polygons with the aid of the linear segments such that the generated polygons are convex and contiguous linear segments result in contiguous polygons. A mapping is identified between segments of the bitmap brush and the polygons such that the corners or the boundaries of the segments of a segment map to the corners or boundaries of a corresponding polygon. The segment of the bitmap brush is mapped into the corresponding polygon using transformations that do not require visiting a pixel in the rendered warped brush stroke more than once. Examples of such transformations include bilinear transformations and texture mapping in combination with tiling.
