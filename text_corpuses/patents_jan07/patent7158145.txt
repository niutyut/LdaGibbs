title: Method for applying colored information on an object

abstract: 
A description is given of a method for applying colored information to an object (), the object having at least two different chromophoric particles, at least in a layer (A) close to the surface, which change the color of this layer (A) under the influence of laser radiation,


According to the invention, at least one beam guiding means () is provided in order to guide a first laser beam () having the wavelength (?) and at least one further laser beam () having a wavelength (?), which is different from the wavelength of the first laser beam, via the two-coordinate beam deflection device () and the focusing device () onto the layer (A) of the object ().
