title: Light emitting device and electronic apparatus using the same

abstract: 
Providing a light emitting device capable of suppressing the variations of luminance of OLEDs associated with the deterioration of an organic light emitting material, and achieving a consistent luminance. An input video signal is constantly or periodically sampled to sense a light emission period or displayed gradation level of each of light emitting elements of pixels and then, a pixel suffering the greatest deterioration and decreased luminance is predicted from the accumulations of the sensed values. A voltage supply to the target pixel is corrected for achieving a desired luminance. The other pixels than the target pixel are supplied with an excessive voltage and hence, the individual gradation levels of the pixels are lowered by correcting the video signal for driving the pixel with the deteriorated light emitting element on as-needed basis, the correction of the video signal made by comparing the accumulation of the sensed values of each of the other pixels with a previously stored data on a time-varying luminance characteristic of the light emitting element.
