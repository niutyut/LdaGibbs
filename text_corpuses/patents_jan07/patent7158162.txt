title: Heating control method of heat development recording device and heat development recording device

abstract: 
A heating control method of a heat development recording device includes a heating step in which after start-up of the heat development recording device, a heat development section is heated to a target temperature by a plate heater, a temperature holding step in which after the temperature of the plate heater has reached the target temperature, the target temperature is held for a prescribed time, and a step in which after the target temperature has been held for the prescribed time, the heat development section is set up in the recordable state, wherein after start-up of the heat development recording device, operation history information from the time of the last start-up is collected; and after reaching the target temperature at the time of the present start-up, a temperature holding time is determined depending upon the operation history information.
