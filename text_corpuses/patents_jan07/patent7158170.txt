title: Test system for camera modules

abstract: 
A test system and a related method to perform optical and electrical tests, to adjust the focus and to seal the lens of digital fixed-focus cameras have been achieved. Said test system is especially suited for miniature camera module to be built into consumer electronic devices as mobile phones, PDAs, etc. Said test system comprises three parts, a control system, an auto-focus head, and a XYZ robot. Said auto-focus head executes the adjustment of the focus, identifies hot pixels and black level, tests the saturation level, identifies cold pixels, tests dust particles and white, blue, red, and infrared color levels. As last step the auto-focus applies glue to fix the focused lens of the camera module. Said XYZ robot performs is moving the camera modules to be tested in XY direction and is approaching the lens system of the auto-focus head in Z direction. Said control system has interfaces to both, XYZ robot and auto-focus hand and is comprising interfaces and a frame grabber.
