title: Digital camera

abstract: 
A digital camera having small time lag for recording the object after releasing a shutter by employing less movable parts, and by employing an image sensor for other purpose as well as actual forming picture image for recording the object is provided. According to one aspect of the present invention, a digital camera includes an image sensor having a plurality of two-dimensionally arranged pixels capable of selectively reading out signals from desired pixels and capable of adding signals of at least two pixels prior to getting the output from the image sensor, a first processor for processing outputs got from the individuals of the pixels of the image sensor to form a picture image of an object of the camera and a second processor for processing the added signal of the image sensor for light metering of the object. In the digital camera according to the present invention, by using an image sensor capable of selectively reading out signals from desired pixels and capable of adding signals prior to getting the output from the image sensor, signals from respective pixels are read out while processing picture image forming, and the output is got from the image sensor after signals from respective pixels within light-metering area are added while processing light metering. Accordingly, calculation for light metering can be processed quickly and a circuit for processing signals output from the image sensor can be simple. As a result, power savings as well as cost savings can be realized.
