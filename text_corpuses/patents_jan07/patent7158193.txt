title: Image misconvergence correction apparatus for less switching noise influence

abstract: 
Disclosed is an image misconvergence correction apparatus having a correction value generation unit for calculating a convergence correction value to correct misconvergence occurring when a video signal is scanned on a display device; an amplification unit for performing D-class amplification with respect to the convergence correction value; a convergence yoke mounted in the display device to control a path of electron beams corresponding to the video signal based on the convergence correction value amplified in the amplification unit; and a feedback sensing unit for differentially amplifying a voltage value for electric current passing through the convergence yoke, and feeding back the differentially amplified voltage value to the correction value generation unit. The misconvergence correction apparatus amplifies and outputs a convergence correction value through the D-class amplifier having excellent power consumption and heat generation characteristics, calculates the convergence correction value, and minimizes influence of switching noise outputted from the D-class amplifier.
