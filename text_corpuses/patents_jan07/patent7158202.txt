title: In-plane field type liquid crystal display device comprising liquid crystal molecules with more than two kinds of reorientation directions

abstract: 
A liquid crystal display device includes a pair of substrates with a liquid crystal layer therebetween, a plurality of scanning signal lines and a plurality of video signal lines formed on one of the pair of substrates, a plurality of first electrodes provided on the one of the pair of substrates, and a plurality of second electrodes provided on the one of the pair of substrates to drive the liquid crystal layer by a voltage difference with respect to the first electrode. The first electrode and the second electrode are arranged in different layers with an insulating layer therebetween. The first electrode has a bent form and each first electrode is connected by connecting portion in each pixel, and the connecting portion has an overlapping relation with at least one the second electrode and a signal line connected to the second electrode.
