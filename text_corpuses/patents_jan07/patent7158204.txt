title: Method and apparatus of fabricating liquid crystal display panel

abstract: 
A method and an apparatus that can fabricate a liquid crystal display panel capable of selectively forming a spacer at a desired area. The inventive apparatus includes a sprayer to spray adhesive spacers over a substrate having at least one metal pattern, a dryer to dry the adhesive spacers, and a blower to selectively remove the adhesive spacers located at a region non-overlapping the metal pattern.
