title: Lithographic tool with dual isolation system and method for configuring the same

abstract: 
An apparatus, system, and method for configuring a dual isolation system lithography tool is described. An isolated base frame is supported by a non-isolated tool structure. A wafer stage component is supported by the isolated base frame. The wafer stage component provides a mount for a semiconductor wafer. A reticle stage component is supported by the isolated base frame. The reticle stage component provides a mount for a reticle. An isolated bridge provides a mount for a projection optics. The isolated bridge is supported by the isolated base frame. Alternatively, an isolated bridge is supported by a non-isolated base frame. A wafer stage component is supported by the non-isolated base frame. A reticle stage component is supported by the non-isolated base frame. An isolated optical relay is supported by the non-isolated base frame. The isolated optical relay includes one or more individually servo controlled framing blades.
