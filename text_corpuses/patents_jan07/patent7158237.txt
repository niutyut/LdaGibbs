title: Interferometric measuring device and projection exposure installation comprising such measuring device

abstract: 
A measuring device for interferometric measurement of an optical imaging system that is provided for projecting a useful pattern, provided on a mask, into the image plane of the imaging system, includes a wavefront source for generating at least one wavefront traversing the imaging system; a diffraction grating, arrangeable downstream of the imaging system, for interacting with the wavefront reshaped by the imaging system; and a spatially resolving detector, assigned to the diffraction grating, for acquiring interferometric information. The wavefront source has at least one measuring pattern that is formed on the mask in addition to the useful pattern. The useful pattern may represent the structure of a layer of a semiconductor component in a specific fabrication step. The measuring pattern may be formed as a coherence-forming structure periodic in one or two dimensions.
