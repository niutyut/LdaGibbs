title: Optical method of examining reliefs on a structure

abstract: 
A method for studying a surface provided with relief features, wherein a measurement spectrum is taken and then compared with test spectra representative of arbitrary structures that are adjusted stepwise. A correlation over representative points of the spectra is selected while optimizing the determination by a hierarchized adjustment of the parameters.
