title: Information processing apparatus, information processing system, information processing method, coversheet generating method, program, and storage medium

abstract: 
There is provided an information processing apparatus capable of improving the operability in producing a coversheet in which plural information is written, and preventing generation of a coversheet having an improper layout resulting from the inconsistency in number between the information and fixed character strings. A plural information field is defined in a text field provided on a coversheet template and in which information is to be written, the plural information field being for setting therein attributes specifying the information to be written in the text field, and a number of the information to be written. Fixed character strings to be written in the text field of the coversheet template are set in the coversheet template in association with the information specified by the attributes set in the plural information field. The fixed character strings are repeatedly expanded on the text field of the coversheet template a number of times corresponding to the set number of the information. The information specified by the attributes set in the plural information field is repeatedly expanded a number of times corresponding to the set number of the information. The coversheet template having the fixed character strings and the information expanded on the text field is added as a coversheet to data.
