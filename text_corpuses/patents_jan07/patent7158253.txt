title: Printer, printing control apparatus and printing system using unique job identifiers, and control method therefor

abstract: 
When a command for the status response is issued from a host computer to a printer, a data-receipt administration portion adds, to the received command, an ID peculiar to each command, and stores the commands and the peculiar ID; and a data-transmission administration portion immediately returns the ID added to the command to the host computer. A printer-language analyzing portion analyzes the received command, while a status-response processing portion produces information that must be responded to the command. The produced response information is, together with the previously-stored ID added to the corresponding command, returned from the data-transmission administration portion to the host computer. The host computer collates the previous-received ID and the ID received together with the response information with each other so that the command and the corresponding response can be made correspond to each other.
