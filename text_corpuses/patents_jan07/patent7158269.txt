title: Scanner having a light beam incident position adjusting device

abstract: 
A scanner is provided that has a light-beam emitter for emitting a light beam, a light-beam deflector for deflecting the light beam to scan a scanning surface, a photo-detector provided at a position outside an image-forming scanning range of the scanning surface to detect a scanning light beam before the scanning light beam starts generating a scanning line in the image-forming scanning range, a rotatable member located in front of an incident surface of the photo-detector and positioned in a recess formed on an outer surface of a housing. The rotatable member is rotatable about a rotational axis perpendicular to a plane defined by the scanning light beam by said deflector. The scanner also has an optical member provided on the rotatable member that allows the scanning light beam to pass therethrough to be incident upon the incident surface of the photo-detector, and a device for adjusting rotational position of said rotatable member about said rotational axis. A through hole through which the optical member is inserted in the housing is formed at the bottom of the recess, and the optical member is inserted into the housing through the through hole.
