abstract: 
R, G and B signals read by a 4-line color CCD sensor are converted into C, M and Y color signals. A black-and-white signal is generated from a luminance signal read by the 4-line color CCD sensor. Densities of the C, M and Y color signals are converted on the basis of the black-and-white signal.
