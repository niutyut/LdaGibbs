title: Polarization modulator

abstract: 
Systems and techniques for changing a polarization profile of light to a desired polarization profile. In some implementations, a polarization modulator is in communication with a stress modulator. The polarization modulator alters the polarization profile of light in response to applied stress from the stress modulator.
