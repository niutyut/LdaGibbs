title: Electrochemical device

abstract: 
An electrochromic device is provided comprising: (i) at least one material that is electrically conducting in at least one oxidation state and (ii) at least one electrochromic material, wherein said materials (i) and (ii) can be the same or different; at least one layer of a solidified electrolyte which is in direct electrical contact with said electrochromic element; and at least two electrodes comprising PEDOT-PSS, arranged side by side in a common plane and adapted for application of a voltage therebetween, one of said electrodes being in direct electrical contact with a component selected from said electrochromic element(s) and the other electrode(s) being in direct electrical contact with a component selected from said electrolyte layer(s) and said electrochromic element(s). Furthermore an electrochemically active element is provided comprising: a first layer comprising PEDOT-PSS mixed with an adhesion promoter; and a second layer comprising PANI, the second layer being deposited on top of and in direct electrical contact with the first layer.
