abstract: 
A micromirror array comprises micromirrors of different properties for use particularly in display systems. Micromirrors of different properties can be arranged within the micromirror array according to a predetermined pattern, or randomly. However, it is advantageous to arrange the micromirrors with different properties within the micromirror array neither in complete order nor complete in random.
