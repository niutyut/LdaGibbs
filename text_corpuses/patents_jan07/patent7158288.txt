title: Long-wavelength-band gain-controlled optical amplifier

abstract: 
A long-wavelength band (L-band) optical amplifier capable of maintaining a gain constant, thereby providing a stable optical output even when an optical power or a wavelength of a signal input thereto changes. The optical amplifier includes an amplifier which amplifies an input signal, and an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) reflector which reflects backward ASE generated by the amplifier so that the backward ASE is fed back to the amplifier.
