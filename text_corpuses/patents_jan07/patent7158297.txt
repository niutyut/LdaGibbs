title: Projection screen and projection system comprising the same

abstract: 
A projection screen includes a polarized-light selective reflection layer having a cholesteric liquid crystalline structure, capable of selectively diffuse-reflecting a specific polarized-light component; a substrate for supporting the polarized-light selective reflection layer; and an optical member provided on the observation side of the polarized-light selective reflection layer. The optical member diffuses imaging light which the polarized-light selective reflection layer diffuse-reflects, while maintaining the state of polarization of the imaging light. The optical member diffuses right-handed circularly polarized light that is projected on the projection screen, when the light travels from the observation side to the polarized-light selective reflection layer. The diffused light () enters the polarized-light selective reflection layer and is diffuse-reflected owing to the scattering property of the polarized-light selective reflection layer (the property of diffusing light that is selectively reflected, owing to structural non-uniformity in the cholesteric liquid crystalline structure containing a plurality of helical structure parts, the helical axes of which extend in different directions). The optical member further diffuses this diffused light () when the light travels from the polarized-light selective reflection layer toward the observation side. The thus diffused light () finally emerges toward the observation side.
