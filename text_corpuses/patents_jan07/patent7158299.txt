title: Projection screen and projection system comprising the same

abstract: 
A projection screen includes a cholesteric liquid crystalline, polarized-light selective reflection layer for selectively diffuse-reflecting a specific polarized-light component. The layer has, on its observation-side surface, a roughened part for controlling the direction of interfacial reflection of imaging light that is projected on the layer. Imaging light projected on the projection screen from a projector enters the layer and is diffuse-reflected inside this layer; this light is diffused as diffuse-reflected light, in directions included in an approximately constant range. On the other hand, part of the light projected on the projection screen from the projector is reflected, by interfacial reflection, from the inclined planes of the roughened part. The reflected light emerges from the layer in a direction different from the main direction in which the light diffuse-reflected from the layer emerges and returns to the observation side as light reflected by interfacial reflection.
