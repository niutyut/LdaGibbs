title: Illumination system optimized for throughput and manufacturability

abstract: 
An optimized illumination system that efficiently produces uniform illumination for exposure, photoablation, and laser crystallization systems. The illumination system includes a homogenizer that uniformizes and shapes a light beam, which is directed onto a mask by condenser optics. The illumination system recycles radiation by directing light reflected by the mask back into the illumination system, where an apertured mirror situated at the input end re-directs it back toward the mask. The relative areas of the mirror and aperture affect recycling efficiency and system throughput, so the system features a larger-diameter recycling segment enabling greater mirror-to-aperture area ratios. An added segment at the output end of the homogenizer matches the homogenizer diameter to the projection imaging system object field size. This standardizes the homogenizer and condenser lens integration, reducing the need for customized parts and thus reducing manufacturing time and expense.
