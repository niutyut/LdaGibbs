title: Suspension apparatus for auto-focus lens device and a method for fabricating the same

abstract: 
A suspension apparatus comprises a lens holder, a suspension spring and a supporting base. The supporting base is formed with an opening for accommodating the lens holder. The lens holder is for positioning a lens unit. The suspension spring is manufactured by stamping process to form a long strip with a plurality of suspension springs. The strip is then guided into a mold, and plastic injection molding process is performed in that mold so as to produce the lens holder and supporting base affixed respectively to either end of the suspension spring in one piece. After that, excess material of the strip is cut off. The suspension apparatus as above described is suitable for mass production. In addition, because of the high precision of mold, the inaccuracy of assembly and fabrication is minimized. The volume of the whole apparatus and the cost of production are also vastly decreased.
