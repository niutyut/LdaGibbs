title: Apparatus for switching optical low pass filters for use in optical instrument

abstract: 
Disclosed is an optical filter switching apparatus used in an optical instrument for converting externally input image information into video image information and outputting the video image information. The apparatus comprises: an optical filter holding section holding a first optical filter and a second optical filter; an actuator having a rotary solenoid which rotates between a first position and a second position. A rotational power transmission section transmits the rotational force of the rotary solenoid to the optical filter holding section; and a microprocessor controls the rotary solenoid of the actuator in accordance with at least one external input signal and the power level of the video image information. The rotary solenoid is rotated to at least one of the first and second positions. The optical filter switching apparatus directly drives the optical filter holding section using an actuator provided with a rotary solenoid, whereby the optical filter holding section is switched to a first or second optical filter setting position.
