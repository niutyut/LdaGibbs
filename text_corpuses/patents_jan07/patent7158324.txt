title: Self-adjusting PRML receiver

abstract: 
A partial response maximum likelihood (PRML) data detecting in a magnetic recording storage device is carried out with a preliminary measuring of write-read channel responses to all nonzero binary combinations of a given length. Decoding of the user data is performed according to a Viterbi algorithm, where the previously measured responses are used as expected samples for branch metric calculations. The measurement of the write-read channel responses and the decoding of the user data are fulfilled by a self-adjusting PRML receiver that contains a controllable clock recovery, a responses accumulator and an adjustable Viterbi detector. The controllable clock recovery produces a set of read-back signal samples containing exactly one sample per bit with or without phase error correction. The responses accumulator calculates averaged responses of the write-read channel. The adjustable Viterbi detector reconstructs the user data that were written to the disk.
