title: Magnetic disk storage system

abstract: 
The present invention provides a magnetic disk storage system including a spindle motor that rotates a magnetic disk, a spindle motor drive circuit that rotatably drives the spindle motor, a magnetic head that performs reading of information on the magnetic disk, a voice coil motor that moves the magnetic head, and a voice coil motor drive circuit that drives the voice coil motor. When the magnetic head is loaded from a standby position to the surface of the magnetic disk, the rotational speed of the spindle motor is made slower than a rotational speed at a normal operation. Upon power-off, the spindle motor drive circuit is caused to carry out a stepup converter operation to thereby generate a voltage higher than a back electromotive voltage, and causes a control circuit and a drive circuit to operate by the high voltage to thereby enable speed control at the movement of the magnetic head to a predetermined standby position.
