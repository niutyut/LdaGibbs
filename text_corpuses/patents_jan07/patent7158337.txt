title: Method and apparatus for providing positional information on a disk

abstract: 
The present invention is a method and apparatus for positioning a read/write head in a hard disk drive. The method comprises providing a disk having a at least one side with a plurality of tracks, where each of the tracks has a servo field with servo bits. The servo bits are read to provide a position signal for positioning a read/write head. The method determines a difference in position between an initial and a subsequent position of the read/write head on a track, where the subsequent location occurs after the read/write head has moved one revolution from the initial position on the track. The initial and subsequent positions are offset laterally. The method generates a compensation signal based on the initial position, the subsequent position and the difference. The position signal and the compensation signal are combined to provide a compensated position signal for positioning the read/write head. Various embodiments are described.
