title: Film carrier tape for mounting electronic part

abstract: 
A film carrier tape for mounting electronic part comprises an insulating film, a wiring pattern formed on a surface of the insulating film, and a solder resist layer formed by moving a squeegee using a screen mask of a prescribed pattern that is formed in such a manner that connecting terminal portions of the wiring pattern should be exposed. The edge of the solder resist layer is formed almost in parallel or almost at right angles to the moving direction of the squeegee used in the application of the solder resist. The solder resist layer can be formed by the use of a screen mask for solder resist coating in which the edge of the screen that is unmasked to apply the solder resist is formed almost in parallel or almost at right angles to the moving direction of the squeegee used in the application of the solder resist. According to the present invention, the fraction defective of the solder resist coating can be decreased.
