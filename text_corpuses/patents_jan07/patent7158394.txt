title: Switching power supply circuit with a soft-start function

abstract: 
A switching power supply circuit reduces the time from start-up driving to normal operation while a soft-start is carried out with an output voltage Vout. A soft-start capacitor is charged during the start-up time. After a soft-start voltage Vz has reached a predetermined signal-output starting voltage Vlow, soft start of the output voltage Vout is carried out by controlling the operation based on the soft-start voltage Vz. A time constant for charging the soft-start capacitor is set as a time constant that causes the charge voltage of the soft-start capacitor to sharply increase at least until the soft-start voltage Vz reaches the signal-output starting voltage Vlow after the circuit has started driving, and is switched to a time constant that causes a rising trend of the charge voltage of the soft-start capacitor to become gentle with a predetermined time-constant switching timing. The start-up time is reduced by an amount equivalent to a reduction in the delay time from the start of driving to the start of voltage output.
