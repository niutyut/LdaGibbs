title: Semiconductor memory device having row decoder in which high-voltage-applied portion is located adjacent to low-voltage-applied portion

abstract: 
A semiconductor memory device includes a first, second, and third memory cell transistors in which information can be electrically rewritten, addresses of which are consecutive in a row direction. One end of a current passage in each of a first, second, and third memory cell transistors is connected to a control electrode of the first, second, and third memory cell transistors. A write voltage, a pass voltage lower than the write voltage, and a first voltage lower than the pass voltage are applied to the other ends of the first, second, and third transfer transistors. A first control section applies the first on-voltage to make the first transfer transistor conductive, to a gate of the first transfer transistor. A second control section applies a second on-voltage to make the second and third transfer transistors conductive, to gates of the second and third transfer transistors.
