title: Digital data apparatuses and digital data operational methods

abstract: 
Digital data apparatuses and digital data operational methods are described. According to one embodiment, a digital data apparatus includes a semiconductive substrate comprising a node location configured to receive an electrical charge of a single bit of digital information, a first capacitor coupled with the node location and configured to store a first portion of the electrical charge of the single bit of digital information, wherein the first capacitor comprises a first type of capacitive structure, a second capacitor coupled with the node location and configured to store a second portion of the electrical charge of the single bit of digital information, wherein the second capacitor comprises a second type of capacitive structure different than the first type of capacitive structure, and a transistor coupled with the node location and configured to control a flow of the first and second portions of the electrical charge of the single bit of digital information with respect to the node location and respective ones of the first and the second capacitors.
