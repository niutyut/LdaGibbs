title: Asymmetric static random access memory device having reduced bit line leakage

abstract: 
An SRAM device comprising a column having opposing bit lines, asymmetric memory cells spanning the opposing bit lines in alternating orientations, and a sense amplifier. The sense amplifier includes sensing circuitry configured to sense values stored in the cells and switching circuitry configured to apply signals to the sensing circuitry as a function of the orientations.
