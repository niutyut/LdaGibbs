title: Semiconductor memory device

abstract: 
In order to decrease the circuit scale of a power supply circuit and the area occupied by the power supply circuit over a semiconductor substrate, the power supply circuit, which supplies a supply voltage to respective parts of a memory circuit, includes a word driver power supply (first power supply circuit), a sense amplifier power supply (second power supply circuit), a bit line precharge power supply, a cell plate power supply, a substrate bias power supply, and a word line bias power supply. The word driver power supply supplies a word driver with a voltage generated by directly increasing an external supply voltage, whereas the other power supplies (e.g., the sense amplifier power supply) supply a sense amplifier, etc., with a voltage generated by decreasing the external supply voltage.
