title: Fuse circuit and semiconductor integrated circuit device

abstract: 
A fuse circuit has an actual fuse circuit block and a fuse monitor circuit. The actual fuse circuit block stores fuse information; on the other hand, the fuse monitor circuit monitors whether a supply voltage has reached an information capturable voltage at which the fuse information from the actual fuse circuit block can be correctly captured.
