title: Delay-lock loop and method adapting itself to operate over a wide frequency range

abstract: 
A delay-lock loop receives an input clock signal from the output of a programmable divider that receives a reference clock signal. The delay-lock loop includes a voltage-controlled delay line generating a plurality of delayed clock signals having different phases. A plurality of the delayed clock signals are combined to generate a plurality of output signals. During an initialization period, an initialization circuit sets the delay of the delay line to a minimum delay value and then compares this delay value to the period of the input clock signal. Based on this comparison, the initialization circuit programs the programmable divider and adjusts the number of delayed clock signals combined to generate the output signals. More specifically, as the frequency of the reference clock signal increases, the divider is programmed to divide by a greater number, and a larger number of delay clock signals are combined to generate the output signals.
