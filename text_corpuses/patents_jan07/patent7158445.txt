title: Apparatus and method for seismic data acquisition

abstract: 
A seismic data acquisition system includes a connector housing and a mating electrical circuitry module. A single interface couples electrical circuitry housed in the electrical circuitry module to one or more signal data carriers that are consolidated at a single location in the connector housing. Preferably, the connector housing and electrical circuitry module each have a substantially contaminant-free interior regardless of whether these two parts are mated. An alternate connector housing has two plug casings, each of which are provided with a plug. A complementary alternate electrical circuitry module includes two receptacles complementary to the plugs and an interior space for holding the electrical circuitry. A locking pin disposed within the plug casing selectively engages the electrical circuitry module. A method for establishing communication between electrical circuitry and the carriers and external devices includes providing a single communication interface between the carrier and the electrical circuitry.
