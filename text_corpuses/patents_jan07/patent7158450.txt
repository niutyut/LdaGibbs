title: Optical element, optical head, optical recording reproducing apparatus and optical recording/reproducing method

abstract: 
The invention presents an optical element with which an optical head can be configured, in which there is little deterioration of the correctional effect when the objective lens shifts, as well as an optical head and an optical recording/reproducing apparatus using such an optical element. The invention also presents a novel optical recording/reproducing apparatus and optical recording/reproducing method. The optical element, includes a first voltage application electrode , a first opposing electrode  arranged in opposition to the first voltage application electrode , and a first phase changing layer  arranged between the first voltage application electrode  and the first opposing electrode . By changing a voltage between the first voltage application electrode  and the first opposing electrode , a phase that converts plane waves into spherical waves is imparted on light that is incident on the first phase changing layer
