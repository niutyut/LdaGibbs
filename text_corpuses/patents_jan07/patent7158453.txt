title: Tracking control system and method for tracking control

abstract: 
A tracking control system for outputting a tracking control signal for an optical pickup including a plurality of light detecting sections each of which converts reflected light of a light beam applied to an optical disk into an electric signal, and outputs the signal, includes: a balance correction amount calculating section for obtaining, as a balance correction amount, a value by which a differential phase tracking error signal based on each output of the light detecting sections should be shifted in accordance with a direct-current component of a differential amplitude tracking error signal based on each output of the light detecting sections such that a direct-current component of the differential phase tracking error signal approaches a given reference potential; a balance changing section for shifting the differential phase tracking error signal in accordance with the balance correction amount; and a tracking control section for generating the tracking control signal in accordance with the differential phase tracking error signal after the shift.
