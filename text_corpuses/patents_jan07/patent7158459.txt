title: Apparatus for discriminating optical recording medium and method for discriminating optical recording medium

abstract: 
It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for discriminating an optical recording medium which can reliably discriminate the kind of an optical recording medium even in the case where the optical recording medium to be discriminated is warped and formed with periodical undulation in the circumferential direction thereof.
The apparatus  for discriminating an optical recording medium according to the present invention includes a first electrode  a second electrode  a third electrode  a fourth electrode  an alternating current signal generation circuit  for applying an alternating current signal A to the first electrode  and the third electrode  a detection circuit  for detecting the level of an alternating current signal B appearing at the second electrode  and the level of an alternating current signal B appearing at the fourth electrode  a supporting mechanism  for supporting the first electrode  and the second electrode  a supporting mechanism  for supporting the third electrode  and the fourth electrode  a driving mechanism  for vertically moving the supporting mechanism  a driving mechanism  for vertically moving the supporting mechanism  and a control circuit  for controlling the operations of the alternating current signal generation circuit  the detection circuit  the driving mechanism  and the driving mechanism  and a table is provided in the control circuit
