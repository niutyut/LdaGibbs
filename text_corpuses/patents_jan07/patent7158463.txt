title: High-density disk recording medium and apparatus and method of reproducing data recorded therein

abstract: 
The present invention relates to a disk recording medium such as a CD or a DVD in which data is recorded in high-density, and method and apparatus for reproducing data recorded in the high-density disk recording medium. The data reproducing method and apparatus according to the present invention converts a high-frequency signal reproduced from the disk into a plurality of binary signals through comparing the reproduced signal with two or more slicing levels which are different each other, selects one of the plurality of binary signals or a periodic pulse signal based on the difference magnitude between the plurality of binary signals, synchronizes a reference clock with the selected signal, and restores the selected signal into bit stream using the synchronized reference clock. This method and apparatus enables mark or pit and/or space shorter than the radius of a reproducing beam spot to be restored into corresponding bit train, therefore, enhancing the recording capacity of a track formed on an optical disk.
