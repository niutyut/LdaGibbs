title: OFDM receiver using polar coordinate system and method thereof

abstract: 
A received signal is converted into a digital signal through an A/D converter and then converted into the polar coordinate system. A synchronizer removes a frequency offset from the digital signal, the digital signal is again converted into an orthogonal coordinate system and a fast fourier transform is performed with a FFT. The digital signal is again converted into the polar coordinate system. An equalizer and a phase compensator compensate respectively a channel distortion and a phase error to the digital signal. Thus, the OFDM receiver using polar coordinate system and method thereof of the present invention can reduce the number of adders and multipliers required in a frequency synchronization, a compensation for channel influence, and a removal of remaining phase error by processing the signal in the polar coordinate system, thereby simplifying the calculation process and the receiver.
