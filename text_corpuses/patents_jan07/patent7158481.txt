title: Method for predicting a fill-up level of a buffer in an ATM network element

abstract: 
The present invention proposes a method for predicting a fill-up level of a buffer in an ATM network element, wherein for a respective one of at least one ongoing transmission connection (T, . . . Ti, . . . Tn) via said ATM network element (ATM_NWE), cells (C, . . . , Ci, . . . , Cn) are input to said buffer (BUF) with a respective input cell rate, and said ATM network element outputs said cells at a predetermined output cell rate; comprising the steps of: measuring a momentary fill-up level of said buffer after each respective time interval (A), determining a slope of the fill-up level of said buffer for the immediately preceding time interval, and estimating the fill-up level of said buffer to be reached after the subsequent time interval based on said slope of the fill-up level for the immediately preceding time interval. Also, the present invention proposes a method for connection admission control for such an ATM network element said method making use of the proposed scheme for predicting a fill-up level of said buffer in said ATM network element, and further denies and/or accepts a new transmission connection requested to be handled by said ATM network element based on the predicted fill-up level of said buffer. Still further, the present invention aims at correspondingly adapted control devices within an ATM network.
