title: Method and apparatus for preventing received data from corrupting previously processed data in a wireless communications system

abstract: 
A communication system includes a forward link from a base station to multiple mobile units, the forward link having multiple shared channels (SHCH's), multiple shared control channels (SHCCH's), and multiple dedicated pointer control channels (DPTRCH's), and utilizes HARQ error control for error detection and error correction. The mobile unit, when listening to the DPTRCH, uses a SHCCH pointed to by the DPTRCH to demodulate and decode data on the SHCH. Throughput problems may arise in the system when the mobile unit combines and decodes the wrong SHCH data, that is, SHCH data that is intended for a different mobile unit, or may incorrectly decodes SHCH data that is intended for the mobile unit. In order to improve the data throughput of the system, the systems employs a flush test and an energy detector test to prevent improperly decoded data blocks from corrupting properly decoded data blocks.
