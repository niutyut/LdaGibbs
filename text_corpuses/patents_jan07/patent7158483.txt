title: Communication node and communication terminal

abstract: 
The disclosed communication node has a function for recognizing one communication node on the first network as one of constituent elements in own communication node, and a function for disclosing an own configuration information regarding the constituent elements as recognized above, to another communication node on the second network. Also, the disclosed communication terminal has a function for disclosing functions in the own communication terminal as Sub Units in an AV/C (Audio/Visual Control) protocol executed on an IEEE 1394 bus, and a function for receiving at least a part of information regarding Sub Units existing in the communication node on the second network with which it is communicating. Together, these communication node and communication terminal make it possible to transmit various information transferred on the IEEE 1394 bus, to the radio node that is connected by the radio interface, and it becomes possible to execute the data communications as if the connection to the IEEE 1394 bus is made by the radio interface.
