title: Methods and apparatus for topology sensing in networks with mobile nodes

abstract: 
A novel topology sensing methodology is provided for point-to-point link setup among a set of network nodes, which are mobile. The technique provided is TDMA contention-based, where each network node sends pilot signals to announce its existence. Pilot signals transmitted by network nodes are used by surrounding nodes to extract various pieces of information such as node identity, node location and potential link quality. Information collected from pilot signals of neighboring nodes is used in conjunction with other topological criteria to identify the best set of nodes with which a given node should establish links. The topology sensing methodology avoids duplexer problems and attempts to achieve minimum collision by allowing the nodes to continually monitor available pilots and transmit on the least-interference channels. The topology sensing methodology can also optionally make use of GPS information, when available, in order to provide an accurate map for communicating nodes and improve the link setup process.
