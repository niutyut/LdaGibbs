title: Method for joining node into subnet of power line communication network, electronic appliance connected to subnet, and communication module used in electronic appliance

abstract: 
A method for providing a subnet identifier to a client node joining into the subnet includes communication modules in host and client nodes. In the host node, the communication module includes identifier storing means; mode setup means for setting up a response mode; response means for determining whether to respond according to the setup response mode upon receipt of an identifier request signal; a transceiver; condition input means selectively activated according to the setup response mode for inputting a node identifier; and condition determining means for comparing the node identifier included in the received identifier request signal with the node identifier inputted by the condition input means. In the client node, a communication module includes identifier generating means; a transceiver; a determining means for determining whether the data received through the transceiver is a response signal to its broadcasted identifier request signal; and an identifier storing means.
