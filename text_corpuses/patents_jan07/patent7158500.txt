title: Method and apparatus for mobile location center to mobile location center communication in the packet-switched domain

abstract: 
A system, method, apparatus, means, and computer program code for requesting location data in a communications network, where the communications network includes a first base station server (BSS) in communication with a first serving mobile location center (SMLC), and a second BSS in communication with a second SMLC and a location measurement unit (LMU) under control of the second SMLC, the first and second BSS in communication with a serving general packet radio service support node (SGSN). According to some embodiments, a request for location data is generated at the first SMLC and is submitted to the first BSS using a packet-switched communications protocol. The first BSS forwards the request for location data to the SGSN using a packet-switched communications protocol. A response to the request for location data, generated by the second SMLC, is received. In some embodiments, the response can include a positive or a negative acknowledgement from the second SMLC.
