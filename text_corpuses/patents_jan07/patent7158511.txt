title: Method and apparatus for providing directed communications through a networked array of nodes

abstract: 
A method and apparatus are presented for messaging within a plurality of nodes , wherein each node  includes a processor , a memory  connected with the processor , and a directional communication interface  connected with the processor . The nodes  are operative for receiving a message including an address code with a relative target address of an intended recipient node ; for processing the address code to determine if the current node  is the intended recipient node ; for modifying the message based on the direction from which the message was received and is to be transmitted; and for re-transmitting the message including a modified address code. The nodes  each repeat these actions to propagate a message along multiple paths until the message reaches a desired recipient, thereby providing path redundancy without the need for the use of unique node  identities or locations.
