title: Multi-link segmentation and reassembly sublayer for bonding asynchronous transfer mode permanent virtual circuits

abstract: 
Systems and methods are described for bonding asynchronous transfer mode permanent virtual circuits using a multi-link segmentation and reassembly sublayer. A method includes: transforming a stream of asynchronous transfer mode cells into a stream of bonded asynchronous transfer mode cells; demultiplexing the stream of bonded asynchronous transfer mode cells into a plurality of streams of inverse multiplexed bonded asynchronous transfer mode cells; and transmitting the plurality of streams of inverse multiplexed bonded asynchronous transfer mode cells to a remote location via a plurality of permanent virtual circuits, characterized in that the transmitted plurality of streams of inverse multiplexed bonded asynchronized transfer mode cells can be multiplexed into a multiplexed stream of asynchronized transfer mode cells after transmission via at least two permanent virtual circuits, which compose the plurality of permanent virtual circuits, that do not have an identical bit-rate.
