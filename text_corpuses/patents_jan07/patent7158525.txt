title: Apparatus and process for data communication, in particular for the parameterization and remote monitoring of heating installations

abstract: 
The invention relates to an apparatus and a process for the data communication between a system unit () and technical facilities () in buildings for the flexible and convenient parameterization and remote monitoring of the facilities (), an existing communication infrastructure being usable to reduce the expenditure resulting from cabling and to enable cost-effective data communication. The apparatus comprises a system unit () which is suited for data transmission according to a first data transmission protocol, at least one facility () which is suited for data transmission according to a second data transmission protocol, a protocol converter () which is connected to system unit () and converts data of the first data transmission protocol into data of the second data transmission protocol and vice versa, and a bus system () to which the facilities () and the protocol converter () can be connected.
