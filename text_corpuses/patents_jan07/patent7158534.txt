title: Unified distributed architecture for a multi-point video conference and interactive broadcast systems

abstract: 
A unified architecture for a multipoint VC session and interactive broadcasting system is provided that includes a server, one or more video accessing points, reflectors and client machines. The server sets up the video communication sessions (VC sessions), each of which is hosted by one video accessing point. The server downloads the A/V client software to client machines. Reflectors direct audio/visual signals to client machines. The reflectors are coupled to the video accessing point and receive a control signal from the video accessing point in order to direct the A/V signals from the client machines participating in the VC session. The client machines process all of the A/V signals. This system for distributing the VC session tasks across these components reduces any bottleneck effect from using a single, central control point to direct the VC session and route the A/V signals. The server, also, serves as a ticket agent, and is configured to issue and redeem tickets for specific VC sessions and broadcasts through the use of a session booking module. Finally, the downloading process of the A/V client software prevents software incompatibility among participants and enables low storage devices such as handheld devices to participate.
