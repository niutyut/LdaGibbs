title: Support structure for an optical device

abstract: 
An optical subassembly includes a substrate, a heat spreader, and a submount. The submount has a submount mounting surface and a component mounting surface with either the submount mounting surface or the component mounting surface including an angle. The submount is positioned on either the heat spreader or the substrate such that the component mounting surface is positioned at the angle relative to the substrate. An optoelectric device is positioned on the component mounting surface and coupled to interconnects on the substrate. The optoelectric device is thermally coupled to the heat spreader through the submount to provide a low thermal resistance between the optoelectric device and the heat spreader. An encapsulant structure is mounted on the substrate and hermetically encloses the optoelectric device. The encapsulant structure includes a window positioned to pass light between the optoelectric device and an externally mounted optical fiber.
