title: Wideband multiple access telecommunication method and apparatus

abstract: 
The present invention is related to a system and method for wideband multiple access telecommunication. In the method, a block is transmitted from a basestation to a terminal. The block comprises a plurality of chip symbols scrambled with a base station specific scrambling code, the plurality of chip symbols comprising a plurality of spread user specific data symbols which are user specific data symbols spread by using user specific spreading codes and at least one pilot symbol. In the terminal, at least two independent signals that comprise at least a channel distorted version of the transmitted block are generated. The two independent signals are combined with a combiner filter with filter coefficients which are determined by using the pilot symbol, thus a combined filtered signal is obtained. The combined filtered signal is despread and descrambled with a composite code of the basestation specific scrambling code and one of the user specific codes.
