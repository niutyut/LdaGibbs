title: OFDM channel estimation in the presence of interference

abstract: 
Systems and methods for estimating channel response in the presence of interference. Interference and/or noise present on received training symbols is estimated. Based on the measured noise and/or interference, a weighting among training symbols is developed. Channel response is then estimated based on a weighted least squares procedure.
