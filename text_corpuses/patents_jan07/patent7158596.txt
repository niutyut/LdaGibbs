title: Communication system and method for sending and receiving data at a higher or lower sample rate than a network frame rate using a phase locked loop

abstract: 
A communication system, source and destination ports of the communication system, and methodology is provided for transporting data in one of possibly three different ways. Data is transported across the network at a frame sample rate that can be the same as or different from the sample rate or master clock within the source port or the destination port. If the sample rate of the source port is known, the sample rate of the destination port can be created using a PLL within the destination port and simply employing a phase comparator in the source port. Where economically feasible, sample rate conversion can be used at the source. However, sample rate conversion at the destination is preferred if the source sample rate is forwarded across the network relative to the frame transfer rate of the synchronous network. Again, however, sample rate conversion compares relative phase difference changes similar to the phase difference compared in the digital PLL mode. As a further alternative, sample rates within the source and destination ports can be derived from the network frame rate using fractional dividers in the source and destination ports.
