title: Method and device for identifying a data packet in a data stream

abstract: 
The invention relates to a method and a device for identifying a data packet in a data stream, in which by means of a d.c. voltage quota determining circuit () the d.c. voltage quota (dc) for a demodulated digital input signal (S) is calculated, in which a k-bit word is allocated to the input signal (S), in that for each symbol of the input signal (S) corresponding to a bit a bit value (1 or 0) is determined by a decoding circuit () as a function of the d.c. voltage quota (dc), in which the k-bit word corresponding to the input signal (S) is compared by a comparison and correlation calculating circuit () with an expected k-bit synchronization word in order to determine a correlation value (c) and in which a packet identification signal (Pd) is generated by a correlation value comparison circuit () if the correlation value (c) is greater than a correlation threshold value (c). Calculation of the d.c. voltage quota (dc) is therein repeated continually at least until a packet identification signal (Pd) indicates that a data packet is being received.
