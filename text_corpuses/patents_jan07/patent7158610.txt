title: Systems and methods for processing x-ray images

abstract: 
A method for processing x-ray images includes collecting a first x-ray image and a second x-ray image, determining a composite image based on the first and second x-ray images, collecting a third x-ray image, and adjusting the third x-ray image based on the composite image. Another method of processing x-ray images includes obtaining a first x-ray image, obtaining a second x-ray image, and determining a composite image based on at least a portion of the first and second x-ray images.
