title: Method for determining density distributions and atomic number distributions during radiographic examination methods

abstract: 
The functional dependency of a first X-ray absorption value of density and atomic number is determined in the instance of a first X-ray spectrum, and at least the functional dependency of a second X-ray absorption value of density and atomic number is determined in the instance of a second X-ray spectrum. Based on a recording of a first distribution of X-ray absorption values of the object to be examined in the instance of a first X-ray spectrum, and on a recording of at least one second distribution of X-ray absorption values of the object to be examined in the instance of a second X-ray spectrum, the values for density and atomic number are determined by comparing the functional dependency of a first X-ray absorption value of the first distribution of X-ray absorption values with the functional dependency(ies) of the X-ray absorption values, which are assigned to the first X-ray absorption value, of the second and/or other distributions of X-ray absorption values.
