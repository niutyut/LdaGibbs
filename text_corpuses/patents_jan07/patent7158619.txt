title: Remote call monitoring

abstract: 
Methods and systems are provided for monitoring calls routed to a telephone network voice mail system from a variety of remote telephone locations. When a subscriber receives a telephone call, a determination is made as to whether the subscriber's line is busy or whether the call goes unanswered. If remote call monitoring services are activated, a three-way communication is set up between the calling party, the voice mail system and the subscriber via a remote call monitoring directory number provided by the subscriber. The subscriber is patched into the call on a listen-only basis, but upon command by the subscriber, the subscriber may answer the call. The subscriber may set up a number of remote call monitoring filters, including an ?always monitor? list, a ?never monitor? list, and a schedule of days or times during which the subscriber allows or excludes remote call monitoring. Remote call monitoring services may be provided by a telephone services provider that is independent from the subscriber's home telephone services provider.
