title: Method and system for selecting a preferred contact center agent based on agent proficiency and performance and contact center state

abstract: 
A method and system for selecting an agent to service a contact at a contact center accounts for the state of the contact center and for individual agent proficiency and performance. A software-implemented method includes an algorithm that adjusts the agent-selection process according to variations in state such as fluctuating call volume. When two or more metrics describe distinct aspects of an agent's performance and both aspects are relevant to agent selection, the algorithm can weigh each according to relative importance to the center's operational effectiveness. The present invention couples to the information infrastructure of a computer-based contact center and interfaces with the components of the center that acquire and maintain information pertinent to the agent-selection process. This connectivity delivers real-time information to the software algorithms and thereby facilitates rapid response to changing conditions.
