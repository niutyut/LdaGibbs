title: System and method for preemptive goals based routing of contact records

abstract: 
A method and system is provided for the preemptive goals based distribution of contact records. This method and system includes devices receiving contact records and providing customer contacts to one or more agents. Interfaced with the device is a distribution module including pools and queues. The distribution module places the contact records into the pools and transfers less than all of the contact records to the queues to allow for processing by the devices at peak efficiency. The distribution module transfers the queues to the devices so that the device can place customer contact attempts. A goal module, associated with the distribution module, monitors the performance of the pools. The goal module modifies which queues the pools transfer contact records to based on the performance of the pools thereby allowing the contact records to be distributed in accordance with performance goals for the pools.
