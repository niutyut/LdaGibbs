title: Method and apparatus for producing a phantom three-dimensional sound space with recorded sound

abstract: 
A central speaker and personal headset speakers are used to create a three-dimensional phantom sound space for each listener. The speakers of the headset are located in close proximity to, but do not isolate, the ears of the listener such that external sounds are allowed to impinge upon the pinna of the ears. The headset speakers form an isosceles triangle with the distant central speaker as the apex. This speaker configuration with personal controls can achieve a state of sound equilibrium for a phantom three-dimensional sound space. The sound signal may be synchronized with a video signal, and the sound pressure level of the left and right speakers can be adjusted to control the listener's perception of the virtual movement of phantom sound source image within the sound space according to changes in the point of view represented in a displayed video image.
