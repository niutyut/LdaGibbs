title: Orthogonal circular microphone array system and method for detecting three-dimensional direction of sound source using the same

abstract: 
Provided are an orthogonal circular microphone array system for detecting a three-dimensional direction of a sound source, the system comprising a directional microphone which receives a speech signal from the sound source, a first microphone array in which a predetermined number of microphones for receiving the speech signal from the sound source are arranged around the directional microphone, a second microphone array in which a predetermined number of microphones for receiving the-speech signal from the sound source are arranged around the directional microphone so as to be orthogonal to the first microphone array, a direction detection unit which receives signals from the first and second microphone arrays, discriminates whether the signals are speech signals and estimates the location of the sound source, a rotation controller which changes the direction of the first microphone array, the second microphone array, and the directional microphone according to the location of the sound source estimated by the direction detection unit, and a speech signal processing unit which performs an arithmetic operation on the speech signal received by the directional microphone and the speech signal received by the first and second microphone arrays and outputs a resultant speech signal, and a method for estimating a speaker's three-dimensional location.
