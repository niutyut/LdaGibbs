title: Loudspeaker system with extended bass response

abstract: 
A loudspeaker system has an extended bass or low frequency response. The loudspeaker system integrates a passive radiator with a transducer. The loudspeaker system also mechanically isolates the passive radiator and the transducer. A support mechanism mechanically grounds vibrations or other forces from the transducer and passive radiator that may interfere or affect the operation of the loudspeaker.
