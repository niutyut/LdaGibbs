title: Currency bill and coin processing system

abstract: 
A compact system for processing currency bills and coins comprises a compact currency bill processing device, a coin scale, and a processor communicatively linked to the currency bill processing device and the coin scale. The compact currency bill processing device counts currency bills of a plurality of denominations. The compact currency bill processing includes an evaluation unit being that is adapted to determine the denomination of each of the currency bills. The coin scale is adapted to receive at least one group of coins of a single denomination and to determine a coin total for the at least one received group corresponding to the value of the coins in the received group. The processor is adapted to receive a currency bill total from the currency bill processing device and the coin total from the coin scale and to determine an aggregate total corresponding to the sum of the received currency bill total and the coin total.
