title: Method and apparatus for including virtual ads in video presentations

abstract: 
A system for presenting a virtual advertisement or other virtual content in a sequences of frames of a video presentation utilizes data identifying a candidate region in the sequence of frames, a pixel signature for the region, the signature comprising a range of R, G, B values for pixels based on a standard deviation from an average value, and stored virtual content, such as an advertisement, to be implanted in the candidate region or regions. In operation, as frames having the candidate region are processed by an integration system, the alternative virtual content is substituted by default for the candidate region, except if a pixel value in the region falls outside the pixel signature range. The result is an ad that appears to be on a surface in the video presentation, as images that come between the ad and the viewer occlude the advertisement. Apparatus and methods for providing the video presentation and data sets for regions and advertisements are disclosed as well. Methods are provided for selecting candidate regions and for implanting virtual content in various embodiments.
