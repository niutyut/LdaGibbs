In an image display device for receiving and displaying image data, color converter converts the image data on the basis of conversion characteristics data stored in a conversion characteristics storage. The conversion characteristics designation means including means for designating the hue of the colors outputs the conversion characteristics designation data, and conversion characteristics setting means calculates the conversion characteristics data on the basis of the conversion characteristics designation data, and sets the conversion characteristics data in the conversion characteristics storage. The color converter comprises a calculation term generator for receiving the first image data, and outputting calculation terms which are effective just for the specific hues; and a matrix calculator performing matrix calculation using the calculation terms effective just for the specific hues. The user can adjust just the hue of the desired color. Real-time processing of moving pictures can be achieved without placing a heavy load on a CPU.
