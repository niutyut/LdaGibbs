title: Image processing using linear light values and other image processing improvements

abstract: 
Strategies are described for processing image information in a linear form to reduce the amount of artifacts (compared to processing the data in nonlinear form). Exemplary types of processing operations can include, scaling, compositing, alpha-blending, edge detection, and so forth. In a more specific implementation, strategies are described for processing image information that is: a) linear; b) in the RGB color space; c) high precision (e.g., provided by floating point representation); d) progressive; and e) full channel. Other improvements provide strategies for: a) processing image information in a pseudo-linear space to improve processing speed; b) implementing an improved error dispersion technique; c) dynamically calculating and applying filter kernels; d) producing pipeline code in an optimal manner; and e) implementing various processing tasks using novel pixel shader techniques.
