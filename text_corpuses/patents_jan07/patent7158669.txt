title: Image compression method and apparatus, and image coding method and apparatus

abstract: 
There are provided an image coding method and apparatus and image compression method and apparatus which can properly compress a color document image with a high compression efficiency. First of all, a color reduction processing unit () converts each pixel of a color document image into an index assigned in correspondence with a color value, and generates color information () containing the number of pixels for each indexed color and an index color image (). A color information sort unit () and the like determine, for example, a color value corresponding to an index of the maximum number of pixels as a background color. An order determination unit () determines an order. A binary image generation compression unit () generates a partial binary image for each index and compresses the binary image according to the order. A data integrating unit () generates compressed image () by integrating background data () and the compressed data of the partial binary image.
