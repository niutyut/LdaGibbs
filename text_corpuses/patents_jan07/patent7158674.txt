title: Scene change detection apparatus

abstract: 
An apparatus for detecting a scene change is disclosed, which is provided for realizing functions such as a nonlinear browsing of a video, a video indexing and a key frame generation in a personal video recorder or video database. In the apparatus according to the present invention, accumulated histograms are extracted from the received two frames, and then a pixel value corresponding to a specific accumulated distribution of respective accumulated histograms is stored, thereby accurately detecting the scene change by comparing difference of pixel value lists. Also, an illumination change determining part for receiving first and second pixel lists from first and second pixel list extracting parts is additionally included so as to determine whether a brightness change of an image occurs due to a change of illumination conditions. Accordingly, it is possible to detect the scene change without any influence from changes of illumination, a camera flash or other optical elements.
