title: Matching of discrete curves under affine transforms

abstract: 
System and method for determining the presence of an object of interest from a template image in an acquired target image, despite of or using various types of affine transformations of the object of interest in the target image. A template image discrete curve is determined from the template image corresponding to the object of interest, and a template curve canonical transform calculated based on the curve. The canonical transform is applied to the template curve to generate a mapped template curve. The target image is received, a target image discrete curve determined, and a target curve canonical transform computed based on the target curve canonical transform. The target canonical transform is applied to the target curve to generate a mapped target curve. Geometric pattern matching is performed using the mapped template and target image discrete curves to generate pattern matching results, and the pattern matching results are output.
