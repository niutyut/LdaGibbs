title: Feedback scheme for video compression system

abstract: 
The quality of digital images recovered from compressed data in an inter-frame redundancy-removing scheme is enhanced using a self-adaptive feedback scheme in an image compression/decompression system so as to provide for the compensation of the distortion component from prior frame compression in subsequent difference frame compression. Each transmitted frame is stored after a full compress/decompress cycle, and difference data (which includes the inverse of the distortion component from compression of the transmitted frame) representing the difference between the stored frame and the incoming new frame is transmitted. Consequently, the quality of static regions in the recovered images may be improved with each subsequent iteration by taking the distortion component in the prior frame into consideration along with the inter-frame motion information. The feedback loop thus forms a self-adaptive iterative cycle.
