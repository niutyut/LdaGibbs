title: Image processing device

abstract: 
An image processing device for compressing image data using conversion to spatial frequency components may include a dividing section that divides the image data into a plurality of pixel blocks and computes spatial frequency components of each pixel block; a segmenting section that computes an intensity of predetermined high frequency components from information of the spatial frequency components and segments the image data into a first plane formed by including a pixel block having an intensity which is less than a predetermined threshold value and into a second plane formed by including a pixel block having an intensity which is equal to or greater than the threshold value; a compression section that executes compression for the first plane image data by applying quantization and entropy coding using the spatial frequency components information; and a run length compression section that executes run length compression of the second plane image data.
