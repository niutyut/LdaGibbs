title: Enhancing the tonal characteristics of digital images using inflection points in a tone scale function

abstract: 
A method of producing a tone scale function which operates on a source digital image to improve tonal characteristics, includes receiving a source digital image including a plurality of pixels; and producing a tone scale function having a highlight tone scale segment and a shadow tone scale segment defined relative to a reference point on the tone scale function, and that is adapted to operate on the source digital image, wherein the highlight tone scale segment is defined by a different mathematical function than the shadow tone scale segment; at least one of the highlight tone scale or shadow tone scale segments have at least one inflection point; the highlight tone scale segment is defined for points that are equal to or greater than the reference point; and the shadow tone scale segment is defined for points that are equal to or less than the reference point.
