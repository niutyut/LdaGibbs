title: Image combination device

abstract: 
An image combination device which obtains a wide dynamic range image through combination of at least two images with different light exposure, including a photographing means for photographing an appropriate light exposure image and a different light exposure light image from the appropriate light exposure image, a dividing means for dividing a lower frequency region from the appropriate light exposure image on a frequency information of the appropriate light exposure image, a statistic means for calculating a statistics value relating to characteristic values of pixel signals in the lower frequency region, a determining means for determining a pixel signal level to divide pixel signals of the appropriate light exposure image into an appropriate region and a bright or dark region on the statistics value, and a combining means for correcting the appropriate light exposure image and the different light exposure image in tone commensurate with a light exposure ratio thereof and combining the appropriate light exposure image and the different light exposure image on the pixel signal level.
