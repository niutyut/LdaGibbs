title: Image processing apparatus, image processing method, and medium on which image processing program is recorded

abstract: 
Featured are an image processing apparatus, method and a medium including an image processing program. The image processing apparatus includes an image inputting means for inputting front and back images of an original, an image reversing means for reversing one of the front and back images, a position relationship detection means, image correcting means and image outputting means for outputting the image. The positional relationship detecting means detects the positional relationship between the front image reversed by the image reversing means and the back image from the image inputting means or the positional relationship between the back image reversed by the image reversing means and the front image from the image inputting means. The image correcting means corrects the image to eliminate a ghost image of the image using the positional relationship between the front and back images obtained from the positional relationship detecting means.
