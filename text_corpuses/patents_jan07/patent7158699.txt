title: Method of optimizing optical channel signal demultiplexing in a monolithic receiver photonic integrated circuit (RxPIC)

abstract: 
A method is disclosed for optimizing optical channel signal demultiplexing in a monolithic receiver photonic integrated circuit (RxPIC) chip by providing an integrated channel signal demultiplexing with multiple waveguide input verniers provided to an WDM signal demultiplexer. The RxPIC chip may optionally include an integrated amplifier in at least some of the waveguide input verniers. The RxPIC chip may be comprised of, in monolithic form, a plurality of optional semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) at the input of the chip to receive a WDM signal from an optical link which is provided along a plurality of waveguide input verniers to an integrated optical demultiplexer, such as, but not limited to, an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG), as a WDM signal demultiplexer. Thus, optical outputs from the respective semiconductor laser amplifiers are provided as vernier inputs to the optical demultiplexer forming a plurality of input verniers at the input to the optical demultiplexer. One of the vernier inputs to the chip is selected for operation in the RxPIC chip that corresponds to an optimum performance in matching a WDM channel signal wavelength grid of the received WDM signal to a wavelength grid of the on-chip optical demultiplexer.
