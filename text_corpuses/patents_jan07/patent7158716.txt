title: Portable pedestal electric heater

abstract: 
A portable pedestal electric heater apparatus for providing a heated exhaust air stream at an elevation above a support surface comprises a tower electric heater and a support riser for supporting the tower electric heater at an elevation above a support surface. The tower electric heater comprises an elongate housing and at least one interior space within the elongate housing. At least one inlet opening in the elongate housing allows inlet air to enter the at least one interior space. An air blower assembly is disposed within the at least one interior space for receiving the inlet air. An air outlet opening in the housing allows the exhaust air stream to exit the at least one interior space. An electric heating element is disposed within the at least one interior space between the air blower assembly and the air outlet opening such that substantially all of the exhaust air stream passes through the electric heating element and thermal energy is transferred from the electric heating element to the exhaust air stream as the exhaust air stream flows through the electric heating element forming the heated exhaust air stream. An elevation of the heated exhaust air stream is defined by a distance from where the support riser contacts the support surface to a vertical midpoint of the air outlet opening in the housing of the tower electric heater, and the elevation of the heated exhaust air stream is about 14 inches or greater.
