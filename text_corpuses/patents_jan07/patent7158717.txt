title: Apparatus for altering a temperature state of a liquid within a container and method of use

abstract: 
An apparatus for altering a temperature state of a liquid within a container and method of use are disclosed. In one form, an apparatus includes an oval housing having a top portion, a bottom portion, and a middle portion having a front side and a rear side. The said top portion has a width and a depth. A plurality of cavities is positioned along the width and has substantially cylindrical openings. The cavities are sized to receive a portion of a liquid container. Heat generating electronics are housed within the housing. The heat generating electronics include a heat transfer element integrated as part of each cavity. The heat transfer element is operable to alter a temperature state of a cavity. A heat generator is mounted within the housing and is thermally coupled to the heat transfer element to collectively alter a temperature state of each of the cavities. A thermostat is operably coupled to the heat generator to alter the temperature state of each of the cavities. A power source is operably coupled to the electronics to power the electronics.
