title: Optical repeating system and optical amplifying repeater control method

abstract: 
An optical repeating system includes an optical transmitter and a plurality of optical amplifying repeaters. The optical transmitter specifies a part or all of the optical amplifying repeaters, and transmits a supervisory command to the specified optical amplifying repeaters as a first sub-signal via an uplink or downlink optical transmission line. The supervisory command is a command to supervise internal circuits of the optical amplifying repeaters. Receiving the supervisory command addressed thereto via the uplink or downlink optical transmission line, the optical amplifying repeaters each transmit a supervisory signal indicating a supervisory result corresponding to the supervisory command to optical receivers via the uplink and downlink optical transmission lines as a second sub-signal. The optical system can reduce the time take to acquire the supervisory information about the plurality of the optical amplifying repeaters.
