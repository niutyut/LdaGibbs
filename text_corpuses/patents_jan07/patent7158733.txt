title: Image forming apparatus which includes an image bearing body surface potential detection feature

abstract: 
An image forming apparatus includes an image bearing body which can bear an electrostatic image; a bias member to which a predetermined bias is applied from a bias applying device; and a surface potential detection device which detects a surface potential at the image bearing body. The surface potential detection device includes a detector portion which generates a signal corresponding to the surface potential at the image bearing body and a potential detection portion which detects the surface potential by the signal from the detector portion. In the image forming apparatus, the potential detection portion is also used for detection of a bias value which the bias applying device applies to the bias member, the bias applying device is controlled based on the detection result of the bias which the bias applying device applies, and the bias detection result is obtained by the potential detection unit.
