title: Process cartridge having first and second rotatably coupled frames and electrophotographic image forming apparatus mounting such process cartridge

abstract: 
A cartridge detachably mountable to an apparatus includes a drum, a developing roller, first and second frames supporting the drum and roller, a coupling member rotatably connecting the frames, a first cartridge positioning portion abuttable to a first main assembly positioning portion positioning the cartridge with respect to a direction crossing the drum axis when the cartridge is mounted to the apparatus, a drive input gear engaging a main assembly driving gear, and a second cartridge positioning portion abuttable to a second main assembly positioning portion limiting cartridge rotation about the first cartridge positioning portion. When the cartridge is in the apparatus, the coupling member crosses a phantom line perpendicular to the second main assembly positioning portion and which passes through the second positioning portion, as seen from one end with respect to the axis.
