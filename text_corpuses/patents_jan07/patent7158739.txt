title: Image forming apparatus capable of stable wireless communication

abstract: 
In an image forming operation, communication with a non-contact type data storage circuit is established by a communication signal of a first percentage modulation, and when not in an image forming operation, communication with a non-contact type data storage circuit is established by a communication signal of a second percentage modulation smaller than the first percentage modulation.
