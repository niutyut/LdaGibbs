title: Image forming apparatus

abstract: 
An image forming apparatus includes an image bearing member; a plurality of developing devices for developing electrostatic images formed on the image bearing member with developers, the developing devices including respective developer carrying members for carrying respective developers; moving means for moving a selected one of the developing devices to an operative position, wherein each of the developer carrying members is movable selectively to be in contact with or spaced from the image bearing member at the operative position; wherein the apparatus is operable in a first image formation mode in which an image is formed using the plurality of developing devices and a second image formation mode in which an image is formed using one of the plurality of developing devices, and wherein the developer carrying member which is at the operative position in the first image formation mode is capable of being spaced from the image bearing member by a first distance during non-developing-operation, and the developer carrying member which is at the operative position in the second image formation mode is capable of being spaced from the image bearing member by a second distance during non-developing-operation, and wherein the second distance is smaller than the first distance.
