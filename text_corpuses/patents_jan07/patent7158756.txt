title: Method and system for establishing short-range service sessions

abstract: 
A method and system for setting up a local service session in a short-range communications network receives preconfiguration information over a long-range network, and establishes the local service session in the short-range communication network using the received preconfiguration information. The preconfiguration information relates to the establishment of the local service session in the short-range communication network. Accordingly, the received preconfiguration information may include an address of a remote short-range communications device, such as a a Bluetooth device address (BD_ADDR). The received preconfiguration information may also include security information, such a personal identification number (PIN), and/or one or more encryption keys. In addition, the preconfiguration information may include an identifier of an offered short-range service, as well as an identifier indicating a location where the short-range service is offered.
