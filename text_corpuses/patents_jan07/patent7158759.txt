title: Dynamic frequency selection in a wireless communication network

abstract: 
A method and apparatus for dynamic frequency selection in a wireless communication system or network includes processing that begins when an access point determines interference on a wireless channel that is being used by the access point. When the interference exceeds an interference threshold, the access point provides a request packet to affiliated stations being serviced by the access point for channel spectrum information. The processing continues as the affiliated stations generate the channel spectrum information regarding each of the wireless channels in the wireless communication network. The processing proceeds then as the affiliated stations provide the channel spectrum information to the access point via the current wireless channel. The access point interprets the channel spectrum information to determine a desired wireless channel of the plurality of wireless channels within the wireless communication network. The access point then provides a selection packet to the affiliated stations via the current wireless channel to indicate that the access point will begin using the desired wireless channel at a particular future time.
