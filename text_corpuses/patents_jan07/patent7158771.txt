title: Integrated circuit transponder having a plurality of high-gain radio frequency signal inputs

abstract: 
A high gain input stage for a radio frequency transponder uses an amplifier for increasing a magnitude of an input signal. A DC bias circuit is used for controlling the operation of the amplifier. A resonant circuit is coupled between the amplifier and the DC bias circuit. The resonant circuit is used for receiving a signal generated by an electromagnetic field and for generating the input signal which is amplified by the amplifier. The resonant circuit has an inductor which is used to bias the amplifier thereby removing the need for a decoupling capacitor between the tuned circuit and the DC biasing of the amplifier. Multiple transponder inputs may be implemented in a single integrated circuit package.
