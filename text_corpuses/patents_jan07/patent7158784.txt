title: Robust topology wireless communication using broadband access points

abstract: 
The invention provides a method and system for robust topology wireless communication using access points. A wireless communication system includes a communication cell having a base station controller and at least one set of customer premises equipment. The customer premises equipment is disposed within a sector of the cell, and communication between the base station controller and the customer premises equipment is controlled by the base station controller is so as to prevent interference between multiple sets of customer premises equipment. When customer premises equipment is subject to relatively larger amounts of multipath effect, or interference or noise, one or more access points are disposed within the sector, so as to propagate or route communication between the base station controller and one or more sets of customer premises equipment. The access points may range in complexity from simple reflectors, to repeaters, to routing devices operative within the cell.
