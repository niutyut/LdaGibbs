title: Method and apparatus for auto-configuration for optimum multimedia performance

abstract: 
An auto-configuration arrangement enables a general-purpose mobile terminal or user equipment (UE) and an access network having specific native or standardized codecs and media formats to conform to one another and to thus optimize resource utilization in the access network. When the UE is attached to the access network, UE and user identifier information is signaled by the UE to a configuration node implemented in the access network. The configuration node acquires information details regarding the UE, and also relevant user subscription information, by retrieval from one or more access network registers. The configuration node then uses the detailed information together with access network specific information to decide what QoS definition and type of codec to select for use, and assembles the selected definitions and codecs, such as by retrieval from a repository. The configuration node sends the selected QoS definitions and codecs to the UE, and the UE configures itself in accordance therewith by means of a configuration layer residing in the UE.
