title: Transmission of point-to-multipoint services to a destination area

abstract: 
A system, methods, an area register and a service center for transmitting point-to-multipoint services to a geographical destination area that can be indicated by using a logical name. Logical names must be mapped to distribution addresses. The system therefor comprises memory means (AR) for mapping each predetermined logical name () to one or more network element addresses () of the system. In addition, the system comprises one or more service centers which are arranged to inquire, in response to a received service request, the memory means (AR) for the addresses () of the network elements corresponding to the logical name () of the destination area and to transmit the point-to-multipoint service to the geographical destination area via the network elements. The service is transmitted to cells in conventional manner via network nodes, while a service request is transmitted to other service centers.
