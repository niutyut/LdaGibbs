title: Apparatus and method for measuring output power of pilot channel at CDMA base station

abstract: 
Disclosed is an apparatus and method for measuring output power of a pilot channel transmitted from a CDMA (code division multiple access) base station. The method for measuring transmission output power of the base station in a forward link from the CDMA base station to at least one mobile station, includes receiving output power of the base station, measuring the total output power outputted from the base station by means of an output power level measurement unit and at the same time dividing and measuring the output power of the base station in the same time zone according to each code by means of a code domain analyzer, evaluating a proportion which the pilot channel accounts for with respect to all code domains, and evaluating only output power of the pilot channel by multiplying the proportion of the pilot channel by the total output power of the base station.
