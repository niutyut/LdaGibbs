title: Limited-angle frequency-distance resolution recovery in nuclear medicine imaging

abstract: 
A nuclear camera () includes a plurality of detector heads () which have collimators () for fixing the trajectory along which radiation is receivable. A rotating gantry () rotates the detector heads around the subject collecting less than 360? of data, e.g., 204? of data. A zero-filling processor () generates zero-filled projection views such that the actually collected projection views and the zero-filled projection views span 360?. A smoothing processor () smooths an interface between the zero-filled and actually collected projection views. The zero-filled and smoothed views are Fourier transformed () into frequency space, filtered with a stationary deconvolution function (), and Fourier transformed () back into real space. The resolution recovered projection data sets in real space are reconstructed by a reconstruction processor () into a three-dimensional image representation for storage in an image memory ().
