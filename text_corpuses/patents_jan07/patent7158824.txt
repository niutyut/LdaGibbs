title: Stress reduction pacing for arterial plaque stabilization

abstract: 
A method for stabilizing atherosclerotic plaque with the intra-myocardial portion of a coronary artery is presented. Pacing therapy is utilized to pre-excite ventricular myocardium near the site of a plaque and thereby mechanically unload the myocardial region. Such mechanical unloading results in less deforming stress being transmitted to the plaque during ventricular systole.
