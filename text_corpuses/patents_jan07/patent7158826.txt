title: System and method for generating pain inhibition pulses using an implantable cardiac stimulation device

abstract: 
Improved pre-pulse pain inhibition (PPI) techniques are provided for reducing pain caused by cardioversion shocks, including a technique for determining preferred pulse durations for high voltage PPI pulses. Techniques for generating both low voltage and high voltage PPI pulses are also set forth. In one example, a train of low voltage pre-pulses is delivered to the heart, followed by a single high voltage ?sliver? pulse, followed by a main high voltage cardioversion shock. The train of low voltage pre-pulses is delivered while alternating between atrial and ventricular tip electrodes, with the device housing used as a return electrode. The sliver pulse, which may be only 20 or 30 microseconds in duration, is instead delivered between electrodes implanted in the heart, such as between the RV coil and SVC coil. The main shock is delivered between the RV coil and the device housing.
