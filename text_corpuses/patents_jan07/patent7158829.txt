title: Method and apparatus for improving specificity of atrial tachycardia detection techniques in dual-unipolar or dual-bipolar implantable cardiac stimulation systems

abstract: 
Techniques are provided for allowing Automatic Mode Switching (AMS) to be exploited within dual unipolar systems employing Combipolar sensing. Relative refractory windows are opened within both the atrial and ventricular refractory periods for the purposes of determining the atrial rate using Combipolar sensing logic. In this manner, T-waves occurring during the relative refractory windows are excluded from the atrial rate calculation, whereas any P-waves occurring during the relative refractory windows are counted, thereby achieving a more accurate atrial rate calculation, particularly at high atrial rates, and thus permitting AMS to be enabled along with Combipolar sensing in the dual unipolar lead system. An alternative technique is provided for use in dual unipolar systems not initially set to a Combipolar Sensing mode, which also achieves more accurate atrial rate calculation at high atrial rates. Additional techniques are provided for use in dual bipolar systems. An improved Combipolar sensing logic is also provided.
