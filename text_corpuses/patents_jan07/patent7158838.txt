title: Arrangement for implanting a miniaturized cardiac lead having a fixation helix

abstract: 
An introducer system and method for positioning and fixedly engaging a lead at an implantation site that includes a torque transfer sheath, extending from a proximal end to a distal end, receiving the lead, an outer sheath, having a distal end, receiving the lead positioned within the torque transfer sheath, and a handle operable between a first position enabling advancement and retraction of the lead through the handle and a second position fixedly engaging a proximal end of the lead within the handle. The lead is advanced through the outer sheath to extend outward a predetermined distance from the distal end of the outer sheath and the fixation helix is rotated through the predetermined distance to be fixedly engaged at the implantation site in response to simultaneous rotation and advancement of the lead and the torque transfer sheath through rotation and advancement of the handle in the second position.
