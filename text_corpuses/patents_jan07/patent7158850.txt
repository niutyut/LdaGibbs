title: Wireless wafer carrier identification and enterprise data synchronization

abstract: 
A semiconductor fabrication enterprise includes fabrication equipment, transportable containers for work?in?process and an enterprise information system. The transportable containers have associated radio frequency tags having identification codes uniquely identifying the carriers in the fabrication process. The enterprise information system contains data corresponding to each such identification code. The identification codes are read by a radio frequency interrogation device, and the radio frequency interrogation device carries out transactions with the enterprise data system to transfer the data corresponding to the identification codes to the radio frequency interrogation device. The radio frequency tags may be adapted for read/write functionality allowing for writing data to the radio frequency tags and synchronization of radio frequency tag data and enterprise information system data.
