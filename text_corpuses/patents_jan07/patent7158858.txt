title: Method to determine when a media handling system configuration is valid and a media handling system arranged in accordance with the same method

abstract: 
A media handling system comprises a configuration of N linked modules. Each module has an order based on the module's linkage in the configuration. Thus, a first module of order 1 links to a second module of order 2, the second module links to a third module of order 3, etc., and an (N?1)th module of order (N?1) links to an Nth module of order N. A feeder module feeds a sheet of media to downstream modules. Each downstream module sends a reporting message to an included controller. The reporting message includes the time the module processed the sheet and the module's reported type. For each reporting module, the controller determines the module's order and type based on the reported time and reported type in the module's reporting message. The controller validates the configuration by determining when the order and the type for the reporting modules match a predetermined pattern.
