title: Waypoint navigation

abstract: 
The invention relates to remote control of an unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV, () from a control station () by means of a wireless command link (). The UAV () may be controlled in an autonomous mode wherein it flies according to a primary route (R, R?) defined by a first set of predefined waypoints (WP?WP, IP). The UAV () may also be controlled in a manual mode wherein it flies according to an alternative primary route (R?) defined in real-time by control commands received via the wireless command link (). Flight control parameters are monitored in both modes, and in case a major alarm condition occurs, the UAV () is controlled to follow an emergency route (R?) defined by a second set of predefined waypoints (HP?HP, TP?TP, IP). Particularly, a major alarm condition is activated if an engine failure is detected. Then, the emergency route (R?) involves flying the UAV () to an air space above a termination waypoint (TP) on the ground at which it is estimated that the vehicle's () flight may be ended without injuring any personnel or causing uncontrolled material damages.
