title: Navigation system for a vehicle

abstract: 
A navigation system suitable for use in a vehicle includes an interior rearview mirror assembly having an interior reflective element. A database at a site remote from the vehicle includes map data and/or directory data. A global-positioning system receiver is operable to receive signals from satellites external to said vehicles. A transceiver is operable to engage in a wireless communication with a remote transceiver located at a site remote from the vehicle to received data derived from the database. A user input allows a user to input a destination. The system responds to an input of a destination by wirelessly communicating the destination to the remote transceiver and downloading directions. A display that displays turn-by-turn instructions to the destination during the road journey based on the downloaded directions and on the signals received by the global-positioning system receiver. The turn-by-turn instructions may include (i) direction, (ii) when to turn, and/or (iii) how far until the turn. The navigation system preferably includes a short-range wireless communication link.
