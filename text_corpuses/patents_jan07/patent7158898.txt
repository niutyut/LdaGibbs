abstract: 
In a method of calculating effective power relating to a capacitor, the waveform of a periodic voltage applied to a capacitor is set. The capacitance of a desired capacitor is input. The waveform of the periodic voltage applied to both ends of the capacitor is subjected to Fourier expansion. More specifically, the periodic voltage is Fourier-expanded in terms of sine and cosine-wave series of high-order frequency components. Further, an effective power consumed by the capacitor is calculated using data regarding temperature characteristics, voltage characteristics and a frequency characteristic of the capacitance and dielectric tangent of the capacitor.
