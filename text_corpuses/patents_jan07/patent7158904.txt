title: System and method for correcting an inaccurate clock

abstract: 
System and method for correcting an inaccurate clock with the use of an accurate reference clock. A preferred embodiment comprises repeatedly counting clock cycles in a clock signal generated by the inaccurate clock for a specified period of time, after the completion of each specified period of time, computing a delta value based on the clock cycle counts of the clock signal of the inaccurate clock, accumulating a delta sum value, and computing a clock adjustment value for the inaccurate clock based upon the delta sum value. The reference clock is used to mark the end of each specified period of time.
