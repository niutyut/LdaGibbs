title: Method for identifying a momentary acoustic scene, use of the method and hearing device

abstract: 
A method and a device for identifying an acoustic scene are provided, whereas the method comprises the steps that an acoustic input signal, preferably recorded by at least one microphone, is processed in at least two processing stages in such a manner that an extraction phase is provided in at least one of the at least two processing stages, in which extraction phase characteristic features are extracted from the input signal, and that an identification phase is provided in each processing stage, in which identification phase the extracted characteristic features are classified. According to the classification of the features, class information is generated in at least one of the processing stages, which class information characterizes or identifies the acoustic scene. Furthermore, a hearing device is described having incorporated the method and the device according to the invention.
