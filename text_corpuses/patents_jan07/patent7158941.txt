title: Residential and business logistics system and method

abstract: 
A method for delivering and shipping parcels using a secure receptacle. The secure receptacle has an access device that controls a lock which is used to secure the contents of the receptacle from unauthorized access. One or more carriers are provided with authorized identification codes that are entered via the access device. Carriers can unlock the receptacle to place a parcel inside and then secure the receptacle to deliver the parcel whether a person is at the delivery location to receive the parcel or not. To ship a parcel, a sender places a parcel in the secure receptacle and notifies the carrier, who accesses the receptacle as described above. The carrier then takes the parcel and delivers it to the specified destination. When parcels are placed in or removed from the secure receptacle, a scanner positioned inside the secure receptacle reads a label on the parcel and sends the information to the carrier or a central processing station for the purposes of tracking parcels and payment transactions.
