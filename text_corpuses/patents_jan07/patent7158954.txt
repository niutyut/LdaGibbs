title: System and method for processing protected video information

abstract: 
A method and apparatus of encouraging distribution, registration, and purchase of free copyable software and other digital information which is accessed on a User's System via a Programmer's Program. Software tools which can be incorporated into a Programmer's Program allow the User to access Advanced Features of the Programmer's Program only in the presence of a valid Password which is unique to a particular Target ID generated on an ID-Target such as the User's System. Advanced features will thus relock if the Password is copied to another ID-target. If a valid Password is not present, the User is invited to obtain one, and provided with the means of doing so, and of installing that Password in a place accessible to the User's System on subsequent occasions. The present invention also provides Programmers with means to invoke business operations as well as computational operations with their programs, and thus to automatically obtain payment from Users who elect to obtain passwords.
