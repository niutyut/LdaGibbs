title: Method and system for identifying master profile information using client properties selected from group consisting of client location, user functionality description, automatically retrieving master profile using master profile location in autonomic computing environment without intervention from the user

abstract: 
A system and method to allow valid profiles in autonomic computing discover is presented. A client accesses a network and sends a profile information request to a central computing device, such as a server. The server identifies client properties, such as the client's location and a user functionality description which corresponds to the client's user. The server uses the identified client properties to select an appropriate master profile from a master profile look-up table. The server sends master profile information, such as the master profile's pathname and revision time, to the client. In turn, the client determines whether it already has a valid profile or whether it should download an up-to-date version. If the client requires an up-to-date profile version, the client downloads the master profile from the server and uses the downloaded profile for various computing tasks.
