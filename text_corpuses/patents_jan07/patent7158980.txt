title: Method and apparatus for computerized extracting of scheduling information from a natural language e-mail

abstract: 
A processor is connected to a storage device storing an incoming e-mail, a dependency database, and code for a calendar application. The dependency database can be built from an e-mail corpus containing a plurality of natural language e-mails containing scheduling information. The incoming e-mail is parsed by the processor to build a dependency tree containing word pairs from the e-mail that are found in the dependency tree. The word pairs are stored as dependency pairs in a tree structure in the dependency tree. A probability sum for the dependency tree is calculated to determine if the e-mail contains scheduling information. If the probability sum exceeds a predetermined value, the e-mail is assumed to contain scheduling information and the scheduling information is extracted from the dependency tree and exported to the calendar application.
