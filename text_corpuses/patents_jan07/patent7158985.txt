title: Method and apparatus for efficient propagation of large datasets under failure conditions

abstract: 
A network of nodes caches replicated datasets in which dataset changes are efficiently propagated as a set of changes even under failure conditions. A master node and a plurality of subordinate nodes in the network each maintain a copy of the dataset and a change log storing change events in the dataset in that node. The change log further includes a rename chain having a plurality of linked rename records created in response to a new master gaining control of the dataset. The master node computes and propagates dataset changes to the subordinate nodes as a set of change events. If the master node fails, one of the subordinate nodes becomes temporary master and continues to propagate dataset changes using its dataset and its change log in response to update requests from other nodes where the update request contains information from the change log of the requestor node.
