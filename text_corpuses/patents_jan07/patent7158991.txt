title: System and method for maintaining temporal data in data storage

abstract: 
System and method for maintaining temporal data in data storage at the logical device level. Embodiments of the temporal volume manager may provide an interface that allows applications and/or application agents to communicate with the temporal volume manager to manage and keep track of the temporal information on one or more temporal volumes. Embodiments may provide an infrastructure for applications that work on the history of data such as temporal databases, versioning file-systems/repositories, data archives, and streaming media to manage temporal data. In one embodiment, if an application does not want to use the temporal volume directly, application agents may be used to access the temporal volume. Embodiments may provide I/O controlled, application-controlled, and/or periodic checkpointing of temporal data on the temporal volume. One embodiment may provide a mechanism for generating temporal images (e.g. point-in-time and slice-in-time images) of a temporal volume that may have their own independent history.
