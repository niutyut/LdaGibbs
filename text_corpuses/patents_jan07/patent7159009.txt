title: Method and apparatus for automatic sending of e-mail and automatic sending control program supplying medium

abstract: 
A method and apparatus for sending an E-mail, dispatching or delivering mail with an animated representation as if a pet were going in and out on a GUI picture simulating the inside of a room. In addition, the user can send an E-mail with a friendly feeling using an agent. By sending agent data which is updated responsive to experiences of an electronic pet as annexed papers to the E-mail, the animation appears as if an electronic pet were going in and out on a GUI picture simulating the inside of a room for dispatching or delivering a mail. The behavior of the animated pet is varied depending on the keeping environment. The electronic pet selects an illustrative sentence in keeping with the agent data from preset illustrative sentences for voluntary sending the sentence as an E-mail to a user who is a keeper or to a counterpart of past mailing of the user.
