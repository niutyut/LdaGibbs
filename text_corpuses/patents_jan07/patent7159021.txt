title: System and method for testing peer-to-peer network applications

abstract: 
A test framework for testing peer-to-peer applications allocates a test case manager and a plurality of distributed test units for each test case, which has a sequence of actions each to be performed by one of the test units. To enable the test units to perform the test case actions, the test case manager loads dynamic link library files (DDLs) containing the test case to each test unit, and creates on each test unit a test object that can be remotely activated using an object-remoting framework. To execute the test case, the test case manager goes through the sequence of test case actions. For each action, the test case manager calls the test object on a corresponding test unit to perform the action. In this way, the test case manager directs the test units to carry out the test case actions. The results of the test case actions are logged by the distributed test units and then collected for analysis and diagnosis.
