title: Method and device for communicating data within a network by combining different communication approaches

abstract: 
A method and device are disclosed for optimizing use of a plurality of different approaches to communicating data. The device includes a plurality of different components, each component capable of being utilized by the device in communicating data with other devices in the network. Each component generates, when an opportunity for communicating data occurs, a decision relating to the communication using a distinct rule set. A decision handler, coupled to the components, generates a final decision relating to the communication of data based upon each decision generated by the components and upon the correctness of prior decisions generated by the components. The correctness of the final decision is used subsequently in generating additional final decisions.
