title: Method and apparatus using XML for both a protocol layer and application layer

abstract: 
A method and system for using XML for both a protocol layer and application data are described. The method comprises the steps of initiating a connection by a client to a server to form a session, responding by said server to said client indicating that said connection has been successfully completed, submitting a request by said client to said server for service, responding by said server to said client by providing said service and terminating the connection by said client. A session is maintained and a plurality of requests for service by a client and a server responds to those requests by providing the requested service or an error message. The session is maintained until all requests made by a client have been serviced and the requests made by a client may be either synchronous or asynchronous. The system comprises a client and a server coupled to said client by a communications link.
