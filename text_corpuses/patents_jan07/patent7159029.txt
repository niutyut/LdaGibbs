title: System for personalized information distribution

abstract: 
System for personalized information distribution (PID) from an information source server () to several user terminals () via an information distribution network () comprising several active nodes (), forming a PID-tree (). The active nodes comprise distribution control means () setting the information distribution process in the relevant active node in accordance with local distribution parameters (parm). The distribution parameters are manageable via said network by distribution control codes (dcc) originated by said user terminals or by other active nodes in the PID-tree. For setting-up or modifying the respective PID-path for the distribution of information from the information source server to the respective user terminal, the user terminal transmits its distribution control code to the first and?as far as necessary?further active nodes of the PID-path between the user terminal and the information source server and sets the active node's distribution control means according the user's capabilities and preferences.
