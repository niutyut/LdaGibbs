title: System broadcasting ARP request from a server using a different IP address to balance incoming traffic load from clients via different network interface cards

abstract: 
A method and system are provided for maintaining a load balance of incoming traffic on a server after the server broadcasts an address request, such as an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request for an network address. The method includes informing each client of a hardware address to use in communicating with the server. The hardware address is associated with a first network address. Different clients may be assigned different hardware addresses to balance the server's incoming traffic. The server stores client addresses that expire after a period of time has elapsed. When an address expires, the server broadcasts an address request using a second network address. Because the network address used for the broadcast address request does not match the network address assigned to the clients, the clients will continue using the originally assigned hardware addresses instead of switching to the hardware address used to send the broadcast request.
