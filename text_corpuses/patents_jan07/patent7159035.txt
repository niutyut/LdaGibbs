title: Unified routing scheme for ad-hoc internetworking

abstract: 
Routing table update messages that include both network-level and link-level addresses of nodes of a computer network are exchanged among the nodes of the computer network. Further, a routing table maintained by a first one of the nodes of the computer network may be updated in response to receiving one or more of the update messages. The routing table is preferably updated by selecting a next node to a destination node of the computer network only if every intermediate node in a path from the next node to the destination node satisfies a set of nodal conditions required by the first node for its path to the destination node and the next node offers the shortest distance to the destination node and to every intermediate node along the path from the next node to the destination node. The shortest distance to the destination node may be determined according to one or more link-state and/or node-state metrics regarding communication links and nodes along the path to the destination node. Also, the nodal characteristics of the nodes of the computer system may be exchanged between neighbor nodes, prior to updating the routing table. Preferred paths to one or more destination nodes may be computed according to these nodal characteristics, for example using a Dijkstra shortest-path algorithm.
