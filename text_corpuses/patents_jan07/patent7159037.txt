title: Method and apparatus for utilizing an existing product code to issue a match to a predetermined location on a global network

abstract: 
A method for providing an interconnection relationship between a product and a desired location on a global communications network. A machine readable product code is disposed on the product machine readable product code, the machine readable product code having encoded product information contained therein. The product code has no routing information embedded therein which would allow the product code, in and of itself, to cause routing to the desired location over any path on the network. The machine readable code is read and decoded. The extracted product code is then converted for routing information over the network to the desired location, which routing information defines the manner by which a user or a computer at a user location wherein the machine readable code was read can communicate with the desired location via an interconnection therewith.
