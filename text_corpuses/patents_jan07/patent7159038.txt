title: Method of addressing networked devices

abstract: 
This method provides addressing for interconnected devices in a communications infrastructure. This is accomplished by first assigning the infrastructure and its parts or portions an identifier represented by a prime number; secondly, creating a calculated or coded address for each device in the infrastructure by creating portions of a completed device address individually then arranging the portions in a predetermined order. Creating each portion of an address is accomplished by one of three processes. First, notating the assigned number identifying the device or portion of the infrastructure; or second, producing the product of at least two numbers representing the same portion of the infrastructure; or third, calculating or coding a portion of an address by utilizing a data-table (FIG. ) to inter-relate device information and additional information followed by a calculation to produce a number representing the given device address portion. A process for extracting encoded information is also described.
