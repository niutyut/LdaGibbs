title: Ultra-modular processor in lattice topology

abstract: 
A Modular Operating Topology Element (MOTE), within a software-latticed network, implements ultra-concurrent operation of a plurality of such MOTEs, as single miniaturized packages, e.g., Compact Flash, each with a full function processor (CPU), a unique resident operating system, and dedicated applications. Internally accessed data and internal applications are invisible to the outside. A host external bus connection handles mass storage volumes, which support file-level data transfers. A software-latticed network of MOTEs defines a network element for a larger system. Multiple MOTEs operate concurrently in a non-hierarchical (ladder) interconnection using a circulating message exchange protocol with concurrent operation of the MOTEs. MOTE resident software mirrors inter-modular processor architecture, permitting support of concurrent processes with an exchange of messages circulated on a logical (software) bus. Each network MOTE is dedicated to a specific system function. Data and software programs can be kept secure against unauthorized access.
