title: Storage system and remote copy method for storage system

abstract: 
This invention provides a secondary disk array device with functions for data management of a plurality of generations. The disk array device  of a primary site comprises remote copy functions. When updating of a primary volume  is performed by a host , differential data  occurs. The disk array device  performs remote-copying of the differential data  and difference management information to the disk array device  of a secondary site. The disk array device  receives the remote-copied data via a virtual secondary site . The differential data and similar is demarcated into generations, and is stored in a generation management volume . A secondary volume  stores the storage contents of the primary volume  at a prescribed point in time. By this means, remote copy functions can be used for data management of a plurality of generations within the disk array device . Generation management functions can be added to the system without interrupting operation of the primary disk array device , and without modification of specifications.
