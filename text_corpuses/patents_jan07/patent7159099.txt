title: Streaming vector processor with reconfigurable interconnection switch

abstract: 
A re-configurable, streaming vector processor () is provided which includes a number of function units (), each having one or more inputs for receiving data values and an output for providing a data value, a re-configurable interconnection switch () and a micro-sequencer (). The re-configurable interconnection switch () includes one or more links, each link operable to couple an output of a function unit () to an input of a function unit () as directed by the micro-sequencer (). The vector processor may also include one or more input-stream units () for retrieving data from memory. Each input-stream unit is directed by a host processor and has a defined interface () to the host processor. The vector processor also includes one or more output-stream units () for writing data to memory or to the host processor. The defined interface of the input-stream and output-stream units forms a first part of the programming model. The instructions stored in a memory, in the sequence that direct the re-configurable interconnection switch, form a second part of the programming model.
