title: Distribution information management system and method

abstract: 
Distributors can verify a signature without acquisition of a certificate for each signer from the certificate authority. A signature part calculates a hash value of distribution information and sets it to a variable h (step S). Signer private information is taken out from a first signer private information storage part and set to the variable d (step S). A signature key information selection part takes out signature key information corresponding to a product identifier pid from a signature key information storage part and sets it to the variable t, n (step S). A signature part calculates a first signature value to the variable h by use of signer private information d and sets it to the variable r (step S). A distribution information generating part calculates a second signature value to the variable h by use of a signature key information t according to the variable h (step S). A signature value to the final variable h is calculated by use of the results r and r
