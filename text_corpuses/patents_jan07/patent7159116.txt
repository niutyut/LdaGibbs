title: Systems, methods and devices for trusted transactions

abstract: 
The invention discloses a system for enhancing trust in transactions, most particularly in remote transactions between a plurality of transactional parties, for instance a seller and buyer(s) of goods and/or services over a public computer network such as the internet. Trust is disclosed to be a multivalent commodity, in that the trust that is to be enhanced relates to information about the subject matter of the transactions (e.g., the suitability of the goods and services sold), the bona fides of the supplier of the goods and services, the appropriateness of a pricing structure for a particular transaction or series of transactions, a quantum of additional transactional value that may be imparted to the transactional relationship, security of information exchange, etc. An important contributor to trust for such aspects of the transaction is disclosed to be the use of highly-secure steganographic computer processing means for data identification, authentication, and transmission, such that confidence in the transaction components is enhanced. By providing an integrated multivalent system for enhancing trust across a variety of categories (for a variety of transaction species, including those in which the need for trust is greater on the part of one party than of another, as well as those in which both require substantial trust enhancement), the invention reduces barriers to forming and optimizing transactional relationships.
