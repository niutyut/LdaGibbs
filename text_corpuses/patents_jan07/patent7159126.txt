title: Digital content cryptograph and process

abstract: 
A digital cryptograph and encryption process encrypts and transmits in a digital format specific items of information requested by a user of a digital content transmission system by using key information, a user's key and a temporary validation key, to decrypt and replay the encrypted digital information at the user's terminal by using the key information and the user's authorization information. Each registered subscribing user is provided with unique key information. The user key is generated by applying the key information to a key generation algorithm. The temporary validation key that is created when the registered user accesses the server, is encrypted with the user key. The digital information is encrypted by using the temporary validation key in an encryption algorithm. The decryption algorithm allows the user to decrypt and replay the encrypted digital information upon receipt of the key information that has a one-to-one correspondence to the identity characters of the registered subscribing user.
