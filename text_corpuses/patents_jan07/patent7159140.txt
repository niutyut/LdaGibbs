title: Method to transfer information between data storage devices

abstract: 
A method to transfer information between data storage devices. The method provides an information storage assembly comprising a frame, a memory device disposed on that frame, information written to that memory device, a power supply removeably attached to the frame, and a first data storage device comprising a first identity removeably attached the frame. The method writes first configuration information to the memory device. If the method detects an error in the first data storage device, then the method removes the first data storage device from the frame. The method further provides a replacement data storage device, removeably attaches that replacement data storage device to the frame, and determines if the replacement device uses the first configuration information. If the replacement device uses the first configuration information, then the method provides the first configuration information to the replacement data storage device from the memory device.
