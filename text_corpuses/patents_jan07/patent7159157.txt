title: Apparatus and method for testing a device for storing data

abstract: 
The present invention provides an apparatus for testing a device () for storing data, which has a device for comparing actual data with set point data for individual storage areas and a device for supplying a comparison signal () for each storage area, which comparison signal () has a first state if the actual data is identical to the set point data, and a second state if the actual data is not identical to the set point data. The testing apparatus has a circuit board () on which the storage device () can be mounted, and a device () for comparing the states of the comparison signals at the pins of the storage device () which are assigned to the comparison signals (), and for supplying a status signal () which, as a function of the state of the comparison signal, has a first state if the storage device () is operationally capable, and has a second state if the storage device () is defective.
