title: Feedback for data transmissions

abstract: 
Methods and apparatus are presented for dynamically controlling the re-transmission scheme of acknowledgment signals. A source transmits a first data packet over a slot s. If channel conditions are favorable, source transmits a second data packet over slot s, which precedes the reception of any acknowledgment signals. A destination receives first data packet over slot dand second data packet over slot d. Destination decodes first data packet during slots dand d, and second data packet over slots dand d. Destination transmits an acknowledgment signal (ACK) associated with first data packet during slot d. Rather then transmitting the second ACK associated with first data packet over slot d, destination preempts this slot with an acknowledgment signal ACK which is associated with second data packet transmitted by source. Hence, destination is configured to overwrite the repetition of a previous acknowledgment in order to transmit a new acknowledgment.
