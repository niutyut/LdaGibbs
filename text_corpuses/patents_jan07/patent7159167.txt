title: Method and arrangement for enhancing search through trellis

abstract: 
The invention relates to a method and arrangement for enhancing a search through a trellis in a detector () that is arranged at each stage of the trellis to select a certain set of state indexes of the stage for continuation. The detector () is arranged, when each stage of the trellis is calculated, to define more than one unequal threshold value for the values of the state indexes, each threshold value defining one state index group, to calculate for each state index a path metric, to arrange the calculated state indexes into different groups by comparing the path metric value of the state index with the threshold values. Further the detector selects from the groups a certain number of state indexes for continuation in such a manner that starting from the group comprising the highest state indexes, entire groups are selected for continuation until the next entire group does not fit in. From this group only randomly selected state indexes are selected until a given number is collected.
