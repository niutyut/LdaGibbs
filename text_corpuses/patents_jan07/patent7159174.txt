title: Data preparation for media browsing

abstract: 
A system is described which includes a content retriever to retrieve and format data and a media file playlist generated by the content retriever from the data. The media file playlist includes a playlist entry title identifying a title for a media file, a filename identifying the media file, and a metadata tag containing data for performing an action associated with the media file. The system also includes a text file playlist generated by the content retriever from the text data, formatted in XML (extensible markup language). The text file playlist includes text-to-speech markup tags identifying the XML-formatted text file as a text-to-speech conversion file, playlist name markup tags within the text-to-speech markup tags identifying a playlist type and a playlist title, entry title markup tags within the playlist name markup tags identifying a playlist entry title, text filename markup tags within the entry title markup tags identifying a text segment and a text filename for the text segment; and action markup tags within the entry title markup tags identifying data for performing an action associated with the text segment. The system further includes a text-to-speech converter configured to generate at least one audio file playlist from the text file playlist and a configuration module associated with the content retriever configured to accept user input instructions that identify the data.
