title: Method and graphical user interface for creating a configuration file used to allocate computer system resources among workloads

abstract: 
A method is disclosed for creating a configuration file for use with a resource allocator that allocates computer system resources, such as CPU resources, among workloads operating on the system. A software application referred to as a ?wizard? generates a graphical user interface (GUI) having multiple linked input screens to prompt a user step-by-step to enter specifications for the workloads. The GUI displays a prompt for a user to define a workload and to configure a resource allocation policy for the defined workload. The CPU resource allocation policy specifies how resources are allocated to the defined workload. The wizard receives the requested specifications from a user input device. Based on the received specifications, a configuration file is created and may be used by a resource allocator to allocate resources among workloads according to the specifications.
