title: Method and system for controlling cascaded windows on a GUI desktop on a computer

abstract: 
The present invention provides a method and system of maintaining and controlling the ordering and placement for display of individual GUI windows into groups or ?decks? similar to a deck of playing cards on a desktop area of a computer display. The decks comprise collections of cascaded windows. The method and system control the decks such that the title bars of all windows of the deck are always simultaneously visible to the user no matter which window is selected as the active window. The act of moving the current top window back into a new position in the deck is defined as ?shuffling? the windows. The method and system further provide auto-deck processes that automatically cascade defined applications, such as Internet Explorer windows, into a deck. In addition, the method and system may also include user-definable options as to the order of the shuffle, and includes the ability to drag the active window out of the deck and to drag any window into the deck. Also, the method and system may allow for the automatic resizing of all windows in a deck by just resizing the active window, and for a predetermined grouping of different applications into the same deck.
