title: System and method for identifying design efficiency and effectiveness parameters for verifying properties of a circuit model

abstract: 
The present invention is directed to a system and a method for verifying properties of a circuit model while providing information to help the user manually modify a design analysis region and/or environmental constraints. While conventional systems attempt to substantially automate the entire formal verification process, the present invention iteratively provides information to the user about the cost and effect of changes to the environmental constraints and the analysis region. This information enables the user to weigh the effectiveness and efficiency of one or more modifications to the design analysis area and/or to the environmental constraints (assumptions). The information provided to the user can help a user compare a variety of alternative modifications in order to select the modifications that are efficient and effective. In addition, the information can provide alternatives along with the cost and effect of each alternative to the user who otherwise did not identify these alternatives, thus the invention can help the user by identifying suggestions that the user may not have otherwise considered. The present invention then receives information from the user to modify the design analysis area and/or the environmental constraints and will analyze the design with these modified parameters.
