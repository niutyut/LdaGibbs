title: Computer program product having preloaded software module

abstract: 
A method and system for providing an executable module having an address space for storing program data that is to reside in a read-only storage medium and an address space for storing program data that is to reside in a random access memory is herein described. The executable module represents Java classes that are structured for dynamic class loading. A static class loader is used to modify the class structure to accommodate static loading. The static class loader also identifies methods that contain unresolved symbolic references and data that varies during the execution of the module. These methods and data are identified in order to place them in the address space that resides in the random access memory. The static loader is beneficial in a distributed computing environment having a client computer that has little or no secondary storage thereby requiring applications to run entirely in random access memory. By utilizing a read-only memory to store statically loadable classes, the random access memory is left available for other uses.
