title: Method, system, and articles of manufacture for providing a servlet container based web service endpoint

abstract: 
Methods, systems, and articles of manufacture consistent with certain principles related to the present invention enable a computing system to layer the packaging and deployment of a web service endpoint on a standard servlet component model. To define a web service endpoint, the computing system may develop a service endpoint class that implements a configured service endpoint interface. The interface and endpoint class may be packaged by the computing system into an archive file. The computing system may use the information stored in the archive file to define the service endpoint modify the archive file with class information associated with the defined service endpoint. The modified archive file may be deployed on a container operating within the computing system. Further, the computing system may produce a WSDL based description of the defined service endpoint and export the document such that a remote client may use the information contained in the document to locate and remotely invoke methods on the defined service endpoint.
