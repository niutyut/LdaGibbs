title: Disc device with disc changer

abstract: 
To achieve a disc device with a disc changer in which number of motors is reduced, and a quiet and stable switching operation, accurate positioning of a sub-tray, smooth clamp and release of a disc are possible, only a first motor for driving a main tray and a second motor for driving the sub-tray are used as driving sources, and a gear switching mechanism is provided, in which driving channels of the first and second motors can be disconnected. The gear switching mechanism comprises a first cam gear having first and second cam grooves formed therein and rotationally driven by the first motor; a clutch lever installed in a back-and-forth swingable manner around a pivot fixed to a body frame and a back edge fitted slidably into the first cam groove in the first cam gear; a second cam gear having a cam groove formed therein and connected to a traverse-unit moving unit via the cam groove; and a clutch gear pivotally supported by a front edge of the clutch lever and capable of switching of connection to a channel including a transmission gear engaging with a sub-tray rack for conveying the sub-tray to the playback position, or to a channel including the second cam gear and transmission gears connected to the second motor.
