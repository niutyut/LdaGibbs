title: Converter support device with slider

abstract: 
A converter that records or reproduces information to or from a recording medium while making a movement relative to the recording medium is mounted on a slider. The slider has at least a pair of openings on a side face thereof, and airflow generated by the movement relative to the recording medium flows in via one of the paired openings, passes in a vicinity of a surface of the converter other than a surface thereof facing the recording medium, and thereafter flows out via the other one of the paired openings. With this, the ability to cool the converter is improved.
